# Nervous System

SENSORY DIVISION Sensory receptors are divided into three classes based either on their location in the body or the location of the stimuli to which they respond, exteroceptors, that take in external stimuli,interoceptors; that take in internal stimuli, and proprioceptors, that help us monitor where our body is in space.Proprioceptors are located in the musculoskeletal organs such as skeletal muscles, tendons, jointsand ligaments. Proprioceptors monitor the degree of stretch within each of these structures andsend input on the body movements to the CNS. Proprioception is the body’s awareness of where it is in space and the movement of its limbs. The nervous system is constantly communicatingan awareness of the length and tension of each muscle and the location of the limbs. This is whybalance poses are so challenging when the eyes are closed. When not relying on the eyes, the nervoussystem must locate the body’s center of gravity and figure out where it is in space.The body can create holding patterns to protect muscles from fatigue. Some muscles are stuckin shortened positions because of habitual,imbalanced postures. For example, some people’s shoulders are stuck up toward their ears without their knowledge. If you tried holding your shoulder up towards your ear all day, you would find thatit’s much harder to consciously engage a muscle. Some muscles disengage, making others engage in their place. These improper patterns can oftenbe reset with awareness and repetition of correct movements through yoga. Showing a muscle its full range of motion is enough to reset it to itsproper length.The nervous system is the master control and communication system of the body - everythought, action, instinct and emotion reflects its activity. The nervous system is made up of fiber bundles that weave throughout the body, muchlike fascia. The nervous systems cells communicate through rapid and specific electrical signalssent through these fibers, which produce almost immediate responses. By stretching and movingthe nerve fibers while allowing the body and mind to experience the full journey of a yoga class, we can help our students fight disease, stress andincrease overall feelings of well-being.FUNCTIONS- Uses millions of sensory receptors to monitor changes occurring both inside and outside of the body- Processes and interprets the sensory input to make decisions about what should be done at each moment- Dictates a response by activating the effector organs (muscles or glands)TYPES OF NERVE CELLS The Central Nervous System (CNS) is theintegrating and command center of the nervous system. Consisting of the brain and the spinal cord, the CNS receives and interprets incoming sensory signals and dictates motor responsesbased on past experiences, reflexes and current conditions.The Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) consists mainly of nerves extending out from the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. These communication channels link all regions of the body to the CNS.

5.23 MOTOR DIVISION The motor division of the nervous system reacts to the stimuli brought in from the sensory division. It is divided into two systems. The Somatic Nervous System oversees the parts of our bodies we canvoluntarily control. For example; if you’re sitting next to a fire and it feels too warm for comfort, you voluntarily activate your leg muscles to moveyour body further from the flames. The Autonomic Nervous System responds to stimuli withoutvoluntary or conscious effort, such as the release of stress hormones if you feel yourself overheating in an uncomfortable way.The autonomic nervous system has twobranches; sympathetic and parasympathetic. Thesympathetic nervous system up-regulates our body functions. These are the feelings of fight, flightand fright that occur when a stressful situation is sensed. Our sympathetic nervous system is often overworked in our yoga students due to stresses of daily life in the modern world.The parasympathetic nervous system down-regulates our body functions. This is the relaxation response that allows us to rest, restore and repair.The practice of yoga gives the para-sympathetic nervous system a chance to do its thing, topractice relaxation.ACTIVITY Explore your sensory receptors. Close your eyes and hold your arms out infront of you. Do you know where your hands are? Do you know where your feet are? Could you stand up without swaying? Could you stand on one leg? Why is this important?When teaching, ask your studentsto bring their shoulders all the way to their ears and hold, then slowly all the way down. Repeat severaltimes. By bringing a muscle to each end point, it is better able to find the proper resting length.
