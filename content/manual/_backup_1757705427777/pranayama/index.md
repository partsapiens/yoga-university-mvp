6 .20© Yoga Flow YOGA PranayamaPranayama is the fourth limb of the AshtangaYoga path. It’s all about guiding life force through the conscious expansion and extension of breath.Prana means life force or vital energy and Yama translates to guide to expansion, extension or constraint.The breath is an essential and foundationalcomponent to all yoga postures and is a prioritythroughout class. The breath should be artfully and consistently cued. Oxygen is the most vital nutrient in our bodies and essential for proper and efficient functioning of the entire body - our brain, nerves, muscles and internal organs. We could live for days without food and water, however without oxygen a few short minutes is fatal. The benefits of mindful breathing include:- Balances energy in the body and mind- Increases body, mind connection- Supplies fresh oxygen to the whole body, cells and muscles- Removal of waste products and toxins from our body- Expands and stretches the rib cage, lungs, core and back- Utilizes full lung capacity, increasing oxygen exchange rates- Calms or energizes the nervous system- Can reverse stress responses; tension,headaches, anxiety, concentration challengesPranayama is often practiced seated andindependent from physical yoga postures. In Yoga Flow Yoga, we utilize a specific type ofpranayama to enliven and mindfully link postures in our practice.UJJAYI PRANAYAMA In Sanskrit the prefix “ud” means upward orexpanding, and conveys a sense of preeminence or power. The suffix “jaya” means conquest or success and from another point of view, restraint. Sotogether - create a conscious, audible, victorious breath.This breath is achieved by slightly constrictingthe vocal chords or the back of the throat as you would when fogging up a mirror, then inhalingand exhaling through the constriction of thethroat with a closed mouth. This creates a slow, rhythmic breath that expands lung capacitythrough increasing the vacuum effect in the lungs and sending air into the bottom lobes where the efficiency of oxygen transfer is the greatest. The audible sound, and the slow, dynamic oxygenation of the blood and body, creates the victoriouspractice.Ujjayi Pranayama breath slows and smoothsthe flow of breath, which in and of itself would be sufficient benefit, but there is so much more value to utilizing this breath. Performing thistype of pranayama during asana practice focuses awareness on long slow breathing by constantregulation of the constriction at the back to the throat and the sound that it creates. The breath is slightly warmed through the friction the aircreates flowing over a slightly narrowed back ofthe throat which helps the body to oxygenate the blood efficiently. The slowing of the breath allows the bottom lobes of the lungs to fill and increases the breath capacity while providing more energy for the practitioner.The inhale is usually harder to keep a narrowthroat, but regain that shape with each exhaleand you will soon be able to maintain this slow and smooth breath continuously, even as you practice! The challenge of keeping the throat position and

6 .21 the breath consistent helps to focus the mind and will help advance your mental practice as wellas the benefits to your energy during physicalpractice. As you teach, remember to release people back to natural breathing during Savasana to letthem completely relax and receive during that final posture.ACTIVITY To give Ujjayi breathing a try, inhale naturally through your nose and exhale through your mouth on a “HA”. Regulateyour breath for a 6 countnasal inhale and 6 count open mouth “HA” exhale for a fewbreaths. Once your breath is smooth, observe the slightnarrowing at the back of your throat, and keep that as youclose your mouth and inhaleand exhale through your nose.The sound you create willresemble the ocean or a “Darth Vader” breath. Now release the constricted throat and returnto your natural breath. Observe the change in your mind andbody from just a few minutes of this breath practice.
“For breath is life, and if you breathe well you will live long on earth.” Sanskrit Proverb© Yoga Flow YOGA

Intro to MeditationMeditation gives you what nothing else can give you: it introduces you to yourself. —Swami RamaThe self abides in its own nature. Patañjali, Yoga Sūtra1.3Meditation(stems frommeditatum, a Latin term meaning “to ponder”)is a training of your attention that awakens you beyond your conditioned mind and habitual thinking, andreveals the present moment. Meditation is a method of bringing yourselves to a place of restful attention in which you are more receptive and responsive to the world around you. Oldestdocumentedevidence of the practice of meditation are wall arts in the Indian subcontinent from approximately 5,000 to 3,500 BCE, showing people seated in meditative postures with half-closed eyesOldest written mention of meditation is from 1,500 BCE in the Vedas. The BrihadAranyaka Upanishad(f14th century BCE) lists nearly 70 generations of meditation gurus and students. In the Yoga Sūtras, the sage Patañjalidefines meditation in four Sanskrit words: yoga cittavrittinirodha“one-ness is the progressive quieting of the fluctuations of the mind”. (Yoga Sūtra1.2)There are many forms of meditation including Buddhist forms, and Hindu, and Kabalistic, and Jewish meditations, and Christian mystical, and Sufi, and Muslim, and Baha'i, and Zoroaster, and many more. 6th century BCE, Siddhartha Gautama (later to be known as the Buddha) left his royal life as a prince and set out to attain Enlightenment. Over the next several centuries, Buddhism spread all over Asia, and many different lineages were formed, such as the Buddhist styles of meditation (Vipassana), Loving-Kindness and Walking Meditation. Vipassana Insight meditation is at the heart of the teachings of awakening. Its purpose is to strengthen our capacity to experience “things as they are” directly, without the filter of thinking, judging or reacting. It consists of bringing a clear attention to whatever occurs in the present moment. There are many forms of Vipassana. Each style focuses on some aspect of the shifting experience of body and mind. - Goenka, focus primarily on bodily sensations. - MogokSayadaw, focus on mind directly. - Ajahn Naeb, focus on suffering. - MahasiSayadaw, note all experiences moment by moment.

ExperienceMetta MeditationSit comfortably and quietly and relax your body. Take some moments to feel your breath: breathe in, sense that you are receiving warmth and energy; breathe out, sense that you are letting go into openness. Silently or in a whisper, begin offering yourself prayers of lovingkindness. - May I be filled with lovingkindness; may I be held in lovingkindness. - May I feel safe and at ease. - May I feel protected from inner and outer harm. May I be happy. - May I accept myself just as I am. - May I touch deep, natural peace. - May I know the natural joy of being alive. May I find true refuge within my own being. - May my heart and mind awaken; may I be free. As you repeat each phrase, open to whatever images and feelings arise with the words. Approach the meditation as an exploration to notice what arises. Throughout the day: The more you remember to regard yourself with kindness, the more readily you will find a sense of connectedness and compassion. reflectionHow did you feel immediately after your meditation?What did you notice about your breath or body?

ExperienceBody ScanFind a tall seat or remain reclined (option for broken bridge). Begin by bringing your attention into your body. You can close your eyes if that’s comfortable for you. Take a few slow, deep breaths. And as you take a deep breath, bring in more oxygen enlivening the body. And as you exhale, have a sense of relaxing more deeply. You can notice your feet on the floor, notice the sensations of your feet touching the floor. The weight and pressure, vibration, heat. You can notice your legs against the chair, pressure, pulsing, heaviness, lightness. Notice your back against the chair. Bring your attention into your stomach area. If your stomach is tense or tight, let it soften. Take a breath. Notice your hands. Are your hands tense or tight? See if you can allow them to soften. Notice your arms. Feel any sensation in your arms. Let your shoulders be soft. Notice your neck and throat. Let them be soft. Relax. Soften your jaw. Let your face and facial muscles be soft. Then notice your whole bodypresent.Take one more breath. Be aware of your whole body as best you can. Take a breath. And then when you’re ready, you can open your eyes. reflectionHow did you feel immediately after your meditation?What did you notice about your breath or body?

271Breath MeditationFind a sitting position that allows you to be stable and grounded yet open and at ease. Close your eyes and establish a simple sense of presence. Now, allowing your awareness to scan through your body and, wherever possible, softening and releasing obvious areas of physical tension. You might take a few very full breaths, and then allow your breath to be natural. Bringing your attention to where you most easily detect the breath, or perhaps where it’s most pleasurable … letting this place of experiencing the breath be your home base, an anchor to the present moment. Noticing your breath … right here. Each time you notice that your mind has wandered off is a moment of mindfulness. Gently bringing your attention back to the inflow and outflow of the breath, offering a relaxed, wakeful presence. Continuing with this relaxed and calming attention on the breath … Each time the attention wanders and you notice, gently bringing it back. Like training the puppy … no judgment. Simply a kindly return. Sit. Stay. This breath, just now. If it’s helpful, you can notice the beginning, and middle, and ending of the in-breath or rise … and the beginning, and middle, and end of the out-breath or the fall … Notice the space between breaths … rest yourself … relaxing with the breathing. Sensing the breath in the foreground, still aware of the field of sensations in the background. You are learning to be centered, balanced, and present for the breath and the living world of sensation … wisely aware of this changing life. Take one more breath. Be aware of your whole body as best you can. Take a breath. And then when you’re ready, you can open your eyes. reflectionHow did you feel immediately after your meditation?What did you notice about your breath or body?
