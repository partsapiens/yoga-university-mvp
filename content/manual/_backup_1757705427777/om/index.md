6.30ChakrasChakratranslated as“wheel”or“disc”andreferstoenergeticclusters,oraccumulationpointsinthe subtlebody.Whiletherearemanyofthesepointsinthebody,therearesevenmajorchakraslocatedalongthespinalcolumn.Eachchakrarepresentsabasiclevelofhumanconsciousness.
To appreciate the significance of the chakras, consider the location, elementand seed sound or bijamantra and the lotus or mandalathat is used to depict each one. The seed sound is to be chanted while a practitioner meditates on each chakra’s symbolism, whether it be through an energetic quality, a deity associated, an element, bodily organ, color, or shape to create an experience or grow awareness of each of the chakras. Chakras are also represented by lotuses, symbolizing the unfolding of flower petals, which metaphorically describe the opening of a chakra.Lotus flowers are sacred in India. Growing from mud, they symbolize a path of development from a primitive being to fully blossoming.The base chakra rooted in the earth evolves into the 1,000-petal lotus flower at the crown of the head!Through meditation or chanting of the seed sound and focus on the chakras, a practitioner connects to the energy or element of the chakras and awakens a path for prana to flow. We can then better understand ourselves, the world around us and the world within us. The seed sounds and elements of earth, water, fire, wind, space/ether are not just “places in [the] body…everything has one of the [seed] sounds and elements within them…and the spinal chord[is] a musical instrument to play these notes from” (Raja Choudhury).Once awakened or open, it is said that one’s kundalini (the sleeping serpent at the base of the spine) prana is awakened and there is a pathway to knowing our essential Self or ānanda(AAH-nun-duh), bliss. ©Yoga FlowYOGA

The Point of BalanceTHE HEART BRIDGE4th chakra -AnāhataChakra(ah-naa-huh-tuhchuck-ruh)The heart (the home of love and compassion) is the bridge between where experience shifts from me to we.The symbol of this chakra –two intersecting triangles, one pointing up and one pointing down --shows that it is the balance between the lower three chakras that represent our basic needs, and the higher chakras, that refer to the subtler energy chakras. THE UPPER THREE The upper three chakras correspond to thetranscendent nature of the human being:spoken truth or power of theword (throat chakra), intuition and wisdom (third eye chakra),and humilityand divinity (crown chakra
The lower triangle: Our need to feel seen, connected, have agency.The upper triangle:How we bring to life our higher level of consciousness and connection to our Self.The lower three: Our need to feel seen, connected, have agency, represented bythe first three chakras.The upper three:How we bring to life our higher level of consciousness and connection to our Self, represented by the upper three chakras

Nose and MouthBreathing through the nose requires more energy because air travels through narrower channel. Air through nose is more filtered –and warmer. The nose connects energetically to Ida (moon channel) / Pingala (sun channel), mouth to Sushumna (joyful mind channel)There’s a natural rhythm (laterality) by which every 90 minutes to 2 hours breath is more dominant in one side than the otherExperience –through your noseBreathe through nose for 2 minutes -12 breaths, 5 second inhale and exhaleDid you notice this requires more effort? Are you feeling warmer?Experience –through your mouthBreathe through mouth for 2 minutes -12 breaths, 5 second inhale and exhaleDid you notice this requires less effort?Are you feeling cooler?Determine your current laterality by bringing your hand under your nose and observing which side you're breathing from.- Right side:helpful for external focus/attention –Pingala channel- Left side:helpful for internal focus/awareness –Ida channel- Both sides:it’s in transition from one to the otherRESPIRATORY SYSTEM Process of moving air in and out of the body using all components of the respiratory pumpThe respiratory system takes oxygen in and pushes carbon dioxide out of the lungs. The lungs pull oxygen into the bloodstream and remove carbon dioxide from the bloodstreamAYURVEDIC APPLICATION Diaphragmatic Breath:- Create mindful eating- Improve digestion- Process undigested trauma- Improve menstrual cycles- Tridoshic(great for Vata)Ujjayi Breath:- Improves immunity- Boosts warmth and increase circulation- Stimulates vagusnerve and parasympathetic nervous system- Tridoshic(great for Vata and Kapha)Breath Retention or Box Breath:- Engages parasympathetic nervous system- Helps the body move into rest and restore- Good for digestion, blood pressure, and stress levels

Anatomy of the LungsLUNGS AS AN UPSIDE DOWNTREE- Trunk: trachea (windpipe) –this starts as one main channel and splits into two --it shares with digestive tract –the ability to swallow is the gentle lock of windpipe (throat lock) which keeps food out of lungs- Big branches: lobes, the right side has 3 lobes, the left side has only 2 (heart is located on left side)- Small branches: bronchi, main distributors of air to all areas of the lungs- Leaves: alveoli, these are tiny sacs (over 300 million) where exchange between oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs- The greatest amount of blood vessels is in the lowest part of the lungs:for maximum O2absorption and CO2 elimination, air needs to reach lowest parts of lungsRESPIRATORY DIAPHRAGM AExperience:Bring both your hands to your belly, right below your rib cage –inhale fully 5 seconds in 5 seconds out and feel the expansion of the belly when the diaphragm contracts with inhalesThe diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle, and it is the primary breathing muscle. During an INHAL Ethe diaphragmflattens out and presses down on the abdomen.It attaches from bottom of the sternum, base of rib cage and front of lower spine. All ofthe fibers run up and insert on the central tendonTRANSVERSE ABDOMINIS BExperience:bring both your hands to your belly, right below your rib cage –inhale fully 5 seconds in and 5 seconds out and feel the contraction of your transverse abs with your slow exhalesBreathing drill: isometric hold in cobra to experience your breathing musclesDeep layer of your coreMuscle fibers run horizontally and span from your lower ribs, lumbar fascia, front of your iliac crest, and inguinal ligament; connects to your lineaalba and your pubic boneWhile the diaphragm relaxing reduces tension allowing exhale –the transverse abs aid by pulling back in the abdominal organs which were pushed out by the diaphragm, helpful with a conscious or forced exhaleBEYOND THE LUNGS- Diffusion: the exchange of gases, occurs in the alveoli- Hemoglobin:oxygen attaches to red blood cells and is carried through the body- Cells:the oxygen from the blood combines with glucose to create cellular energy (ATP –adenosine triphosphate)- Mitochondria:the part of the cell where cellular respiration occursand energy is produced- VagusNerve C:The vagusnerve, also known as the vagal nerves, are the main nerves of your parasympathetic nervous system.

Pranayama 3 TYPES OF BREATHING Clavicular:an expansion of chest breathing (when belly breathing isn’t possible due to pregnancy or athletic core engagement) where clavicles lift to allow air to top of lungs.Thoracic:also known as chest breathing.The diaphragm is kept short and just the intercostal muscles work to expand and contract the diameter of the rib cage.This type of breathing is directly connected to the sympathetic nervous system and is effective for fight/flight.Diaphragmatic:also known as full or complete breathing.When the diaphragm is fully used,the bottom areas of the lungs, where most blood vessels are located, is used to create the most efficient exchange ofO2and CO2. For this contraction to fully happen, it’s necessary for the core muscles (primarily TA) to soften/contract long so that abdominal organs can move down and out.This type of breathing is directly connected to the parasympathetic nervous system.Breathing this way will take someone from fight/flight into rest/digest.NEW TO YOGA BREATHING Complete Breath –requires conscious use of diaphragm, internal and external intercostals, and transverse abs –an excellent place to begin as most people haven’t used their diaphragms to breathe since they were infants:- Inhale –fill your belly- Exhale –empty your bellyVictorious Breath (Ujjayi) –gently tone the muscles of your throat to create a softly audible, oceanic sound- Like root lock, the muscular toning is very gentle –like the way a baby grasps your finger- Sound is audible to you, perhaps the person next to you, and not the person across the room- Like breathing through the nose instead of mouth –victorious breath will further narrow the passageway of air to travel through which will require greater energy and will result in warmingADVANCED PRACTICE Box Breath (Sama VrittiPranayama) (pictured)Supports the parasympathetic nervous system ”rest and digest” system, especially when stressed and if the sympathetic nervous system, ”fight or flight” system, aims to create equal breath pattern of the inhales and exhales, with a pause in between. The breath retention practice can be considered an advanced practice as it can be stress or anxiety inducing and not recommended for new practitioners.ExperienceCreate a “box” with your breath With equal parts of inhale, hold,exhale, hold
CONTRAINDICATIONS Diaphragmatic Breath:- Recent surgery to torsoUjjayi Breath:- Sore throat- Upper respiratory infectionGeneral Precautions:- Any negative physical or emotional effects (pain, anxiety, agitation), discontinue practice immediately- Consult with qualified yoga instructor or your physicianBreath Retentionis an advanced practice as it can trigger stress or anxiety, and students should always practice caution with any form of breath manipulation as it can cause physical and emotional reactions.
INHALE –4 secondsHOLD –4 seconds
HOLD –4 secondsEXHALE –4 seconds

Cultural Appreciation and ContextDEFINING CULTURE AIn order to discuss the impact of cultural appreciation, we need a working definition of the word “Culture.” Culture can defined as a commonality based on different factors, like those pictured here. This is important as culture goes beyond what we may think on the surface. We may have several different cultures we navigate: a family culture, work culture, and a number of many other socially constructed cultures. Photos by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND
LODEN and ROSENER’S DIVERSITY WHEEL BMarilyn Loden and Dr. Judy Rosenercreated a framework for understanding characteristics that we use to create our cultural and social identity. The wheel pictured here is not a comprehensive list but is a place to start. What do you notice about the characteristics in the middle of the circle versus the outer? Defining CultureWhat does “culture” mean to you? What other cultures do you know about other than your own? From whose lens is that knowledge derived?
What symbols/examples of culture have you seen in media? How accurate are these representations?
ImpactWhat are some of the images/thoughts that come to mind when you think about: - Immigrant vs. Citizen- Criminal vs. Law Abiding- High school educated vs. Higher education- Low Income vs. Middle Class - Unhealthy Person vs. Healthy/Fit Person
What are the consequences of generalizing people based on their culture?
Who should determine the level of harm someone might experience when cultural appropriation occurs?A

Impact of Social HierarchyCultural and social hierarchy can lead to inequity between:marginalized groups (minority groups with less/without power) and privileged groups (dominant group with power)CULTURAL APPROPRIATION Cultural appropriation takes place when members of a majority group adopt cultural elements of a minority group in an exploitative, disrespectful, or stereotypical way. To fully understand its consequences, though, we need to make sure we have a working definition ofcultureitself…But there’s a difference betweenappreciatinga culture, which might include enjoying food from another country or learning a new language, andappropriatingit, which involves taking something “without authority or right,”*What is its harm?- The majority group benefits financially from the minority group’s culture it is appropriating- Simplifying and flattening the culture of the minority group and perpetuating stereotypes or caricature- Taking imagery or elements from the culture of a minority group without its original cultural purpose, and misusing or misrepresenting the cultureMOVING TOWARDS CULTURAL APPRECIATION Cultural appreciation, cultural competence and “cultural humility”* refers to the important work of being competent in the culture(s) that we are interacting with.Towards- Self –reflection: understanding your own experiences, family, ancestry, community and raise awareness- Listen to/read about/connect with those whose culture you are seeking to learn about- Honor and respect the culture that you are interacting withAway- Shame and judgment of self or others- Sports mascots using aspects of Native American culture- Continuing racial stereotypes- Lack of desire to reflect and seek educationpath forwardReflect and journal on the below to create a path towards cultural competency. What is something that you know now is an example of cultural appropriation and how can you shift this behavior/content towards cultural appreciation?
What is an example of cultural appropriation in yoga spaces? How can this shift into cultural appreciation and cultural competence?
When you witness an example of cultural appropriation, how would your respond/act if it happened to you? Or if you overheard about it?
What can you commit to learning while in teacher training? How can you expand your knowledge?

Implicit Bias”Our preferences -what and whom we favor or reject…can take different forms…psychologists routinely speak about two systems that characterize the mind: reflective and automatic.” (Banaji and Mahzarin, 2016, p 53*)“Everyday automatic preferences steer us towards less conscious decisions…our rationality is often no match for our automatic preference” (Banaji and Mahzarin, 2016, p 54*)AUTOMATIC PROGRAMMING Our preferences can stem from the mind being reflective -reflecting on our our values, such as life, education, religious beliefs, experience, and automatic, or implicit, non-conscious decision making. The automatic, part of our mind also informs our thoughts and feelings and actions, but in a way that we might not be able to explain or notice as clearly. The danger arises when the implicit or automatic part of our mind has a bigger, and potentially negative, impact. EXPLICIT BIAS Explicit bias is the traditional conceptualization of bias. With explicit bias, individuals are aware of their prejudices and attitudes toward certain groups. Positive or negative preferences for a particular group are conscious. Overt racism and racist comments are examples of explicit biases.*IMPLICIT OR UNCONSCIOUS BIAS Implicit bias involves all ofthe subconscious feelings, perceptions, attitudes, and stereotypes that have developed as a result ofprior influences and imprints. It is an automatic positive or negative preference for a group, based on one’s subconscious thoughts. However, implicit bias does not require animus; it only requires knowledge of a stereotype to produce discriminatory actions. Implicit bias can be just as problematic as explicit bias, because both may produce discriminatory behavior. With implicit bias, the individual may be unaware that biases, rather than the facts of a situation, are driving their decision-making.*Affinity Bias –tendency to warm up and give preference with people who we believe are like usConfirmation Bias –tendency to seek information that confirm our pre-existing beliefs and values304reflectionWhat is an experience (in your life or as a yoga student) you’ve had where you were felt seen, valued, safe? Conversely, what does it feel like when we are not seen, valued, safe?
How may this experience inspire the kind of space you want to create for your yoga students? And what qualities does a yoga teacher need to develop to provide that space?
What can be gained from a more inclusive yoga community?

Inclusive CommunicationInclusive Communication begins with our ability to listen with empathy.EMPATHY Showing an ability to understand and share the feelings of another.SYMPATHY The fact or power of sharing the feelings of another, especially in sorrow and trouble.Empathy + Sympathy= CompassionALIGNING INTENT and IMPACT Communication is often a delicate balance between intent and Impact.IntentThe words and actions youchoose have a specific and intended message. You may not see how your words or actions could be interpreted in a different way.Impact The message could beinterpreted in a different way by different people. The person may have been unintentionally offended or may have “taken it the wrong way”.ImpasseOption 1: Take responsibility for theimpact of your words (if you caused the harm), ask questions (if you were on the receiving end), work through it together, heal a possible division, and honor our collective humanity.Option 2: Say nothing, and lose respect for the person, and create a disconnection.ListeningTalking1.

Mythology of the PosesAs you are learning in your teacher training experience, the Sanskritlanguage helps us to identify our poses, also known as asanas, during a class experience. Some poses are named from nature, Mountain Pose is Tadasana,“Tad” refers to the word “mountain.” Others are names from body parts, Hands to Feet Pose (Gorilla Pose) is Padahastasana. “Pada” is feet and ”hasta” is hands. Others are named after deities, sages, warriors and other characters from Hindu mythology. Virabhadrasanais named after one of the great warrior Virabhadraand his story is quite the epic!It is important to note that in our experience of an asana practice, we may use English primary and Sanskrit secondarily and study mythology from the context of enjoyment and storytelling. However, as you were introduced in the history of yoga lecture, there is a historical and cultural significance to these stories and many of the characters are revered in a religious context to this day.The three main gods (the trimurti“three forms”) in Hindu mythology are Brahma “the creator”, Vishnu “the preserver” and Shiva “the destroyer.” They are also represented in other forms, such as Nataraja (Shiva) and Rama and Krishna (Vishnu) and have several important other figures connected to them like Sati, Parvati (Shiva’s female counterparts) or Garuda (Vishnu’s mount).The pages that follow share just a few of examples of mythology stories.

Ayurveda“One who is established in Self, who has balanced doshas (primary life force), balanced agni(fire of digestion), properly formed dhatus (tissues), proper elimination of malas (waste products), well-functioning bodily processes, and whose mind, soul, and senses are full of bliss is called a healthy person.”–SusrutaSamhita 15/44
Ayurveda is broken down into two concepts:Ayus= life (consisting of body, mind, senses and soul) or longevityVeda= Knowledge or wisdomàscience/truth of life or wisdom of longevity.It’s the sister science to yoga, as they are both concerned with the development of the soul and, to that end, the proper care of the body and the mind.Ayurveda is considered the original mind-body medicine. Ayurveda shares in its teachings (with yoga) how the body, mind, and spirit must exist in harmony to be healthy and happy. All three must be considered, managed, and nourished throughout lifeThe practices embraced by Ayurveda naturally overlap with yoga and the philosophical systems that guide them are the same. Yoga and Ayurveda are traced back to the 2nd Century BC. There are six perennial philosophies, the Sad Darshana, which are considered vedicschools of thought and serve as guides to understanding yoga and Ayurveda. The two main philosophies that we've adopted are Samkhya and Yoga.FINDING BALANCE Two laws to Ayurveda:1. Like increases like2. Opposites create balanceThree main texts- CakaraSamhita –the oldest Ayurveda text (OM and Agni)- SusrutaSamhita –compiled by the Sage Nagarjuna (surgery)- AstangaHrdayam–written by Vagbhata(more accessible self-care practices)foundationsFive elements PancaMahabhutasEther (akasa), air (vayu), fire (agni), water (apas, jala), earth (prthvi)Five sensesEars, skin, eyes, tongue, noseThree Doshas and ManifestationsVata, Pitta, Kapha- Prakriti: constitution, what you're born with, doesn't change- Virkriti:current state of doshas, or current expression, imbalance, can change throughout lifeIn the BhagavadGita Krishaexplains to Arjuna that we are a balance ofPuruṣa(essence, consciousness, divine body) and Prakriti (mind, matter, material body).Our material body is comprised of the three mahaguṇas(modes, states):- Sattva/Sattvic: Balanced,Harmonious- Rajas/Rajasic: Passion, Energy- Tamas/Tamasic: Stillness, InertiaSeven Dhatus -“building blocks” of the bodyBlood –rasaPlasma –raktaMuscle –mamsaFat –medaBone –asthiNervous Tissue –majjaReproductive tissue –shukra/artavaGunas(Qualities):These 20 qualities (gunas) can be used to classify food, lifestyle, and environments and forms the foundations of Ayurvedic treatments. They are categorized as 10 opposite pairs.
