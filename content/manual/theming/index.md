# Theming

WHERE TO START- Choose your favorite quote, line from a book, yoga sutra, yama/niyama, story, parable, etc- Be sure the quote or idea is accessible, universal and secular- Make sure that you can say it briefly and easily- How does it speak to you? What emotions or thoughts come to mind?- What postures, sequences or tempo express that emotion?- What language or words can you bring into class?- When in class do you bring back in your quote or theme? Where would it be most powerful?- Prepare and practice saying the theme to a fellow teacher Select a theme and write the short phrase down. What are the emotions that it brings up? What verbs and descriptive language can you use to enhance or communicate your theme? Create a theme using the template below: LAUNCH Distill your theme to one word or phrase EXPERIENCE Use theme-inspired verbs, metaphor, imagery to create the experience
- Theme Action Cue 1
- Theme Action Cue 2- Theme Action Cue 3 LAND Share why your theme is important to you and a call to action for your students Having a theme to your yoga class is powerful, however, it is more important that you firstcommunicate the postures clearly and setup the ideal environment. As a new teacher, you need to build credibility in your teaching voice before you veer into philosophical territory. If you arestruggling with remembering a sequence, you hold the class too long in a challenging pose or playing loud discordant music, chances are students willnot have the mental space to thinkabout anything else. Yoga Flow Yoga Teacher Training is the perfectenvironment to collect feedback on howeffectively you are communicating. Spend this time honingyour skills in being as concise and clear in teaching the C 1 sequence as possible. When you feel ready to addin a theme, be sure that thetheme issimple, clear and true to your experience. Teachthe lessons that you want to learn; it insures your lessons come from the heart. WHAT IS A THEME?- A shortphrase that incorporates a context or philosophical learning for a particular practice- Something that connects the physical practice and postures to living life off of our mat- A theme remains consistent through thepractice, but maybe phrased and explained many different ways 2.11© Yoga Flow YOGA
