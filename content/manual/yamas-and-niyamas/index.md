# Yamas and Niyamas

The yamas and niyamas are the first two limbs of the eight-limbed path. They are the most concrete places to start, as they relate directly to howyou behave outwardly in the world and inwardly toward yourself. Incorporating these principalsinto your life can have a profound effect on your yoga practice and your peace of mind. Rather than trying to integrate them all at once, choose theone or two that resonate the most with you. Youmay find that by simply focusing on one, the others begin to fall into place.YAMAS Ahimsa Non-Violence, Freedom from HarmingMinimize the amount of harm you are causing to yourself and others in thought, word and deed, by becoming aware of the ways in which youmay bring suffering to others. This is the reason many yogis choose to practice a vegetarian diet. They believe that a plant-based diet creates the least amount of harm to the planet and to othersentient beings. Patanjali’s Yoga Sutra says “When you are established in ahimsa (non-harming),others will stop harming you.” You will be a space for gentle love and kindness.Satya TruthfulnessBefore you speak, ask yourself, “Is it true? Is it kind? Is it necessary?” Satya includes rightspeech and truthful communication, as well as skillful listening. When approached with a piece of gossip, be a discerning listener. When trulypracticing satya, one’s words and deeds are all in alignment with one another. Don’t think one thing and then say something else. Being truthful does not necessarily mean being as blunt as possible.Practice ahimsa as well, by telling the truth in the most skillful and constructive way possible. Gandhi often said he only practiced a balance of Ahimsaand Satya and that all other practices came out of those two.Asteya Non-Stealing, Freedom from Stealing Do not take what doesn’t belong to you. Do not take that which you haven’t earned. This applies to material things, as well as respecting others’ time, energy and hard work. If you’re alwaysshowing up for appointments 10 minutes late, you are stealing another’s valuable time. If you takecredit for someone else’s idea or hard work, that is not practicing asteya. Asteya also means balance between give and take. For some people, this may mean taking what is needed more often.Brahmacharya ModerationThe yogic path discourages overindulgence in many things, including food and sex. Obsession with these things may cause you to lose touchwith what is truly important in life. Brahmacharya is often described as moderation, specificallysensual. In classical yoga, brahmacharya refers specifically to sexual moderation. Never usesexuality to dominate or manipulate another being. Being faithful to your partner would be a form of brahmacharya. Don’t be too hard on yourself, everything in moderation, including moderation.Aparigraha Non-Hoarding, Freedom from Grasping Develop sensitivity to what you really need. Don’t take so much that others don’t have enough.Don’t be possessed by your possessions. As long as you are lusting after the next great thing, you will always have a sense of lack, which leads tosuffering and a feeling of separation. If there is something you want, take the necessary steps tomake it happen. Let go of your attachment to the outcome.

6 .14NIYAMAS Saucha CleanlinessCleanliness and purity can be practiced on anumber of different levels. A clean environment and living space: clear clutter, keep belongings organized and practice good feng shui. Aclean body: clean diet, good hygiene, well- kept appearance. A clean mind: consider theamount and the quality of the information you are inputting on a daily basis and be selective about the books and magazines you read, howmuch time you spend online and what television shows and movies you choose to consume. Clean company: spend time with people who uplift yourspirit and inspire you to be your best and set clear boundaries if you have toxic people in your life.Santosha ContentmentLook to yourself and your own innate goodness for happiness; that is the only place you will trulyfind it. Santosha also means being present. Rather than wishing for things to be different in your life, accept and appreciate the reality of what is. Doyou really need things to be different to be happy?Choose to be happy now. Cultivate santosha by making gratitude a daily practice. Notice themoments you are happy, even if they seem to be few and far between. Keep a gratitude journal. Count your blessings. Remind yourself often, “I have enough. I am enough.”Tapas Self DisciplineTransform yourself in the fire of positive change! The term tapas means “heat” and it refers to the discomfort that comes with breaking habitualthought and behavioral patterns to effect positive transformation in your life. If you have ever tried to break a bad habit, you will know that processis often accompanied by physical discomfort. You also recognize that the discomfort is a necessarystep toward the change you are seeking. Having tapas is rolling out your yoga mat and doing your practice, even when you’d rather stay home and watch TV and eat chips. It’s pulling an all-nighter to finish an important assignment to the best of your ability. Or holding an uncomfortable yogapose for those last three difficult breaths because you know it will make you stronger.Svadhyaya Self StudyBe aware of your actions as they are happening. Reflect on them later. Use your reflections to make positive changes to your actions in the future.Taking time to reflect quietly on your day through journaling or contemplation is a wonderful way to practice svadhyaya. Studying of yoga texts andscriptures is also said to be a form of svadhyaya, as you are studying the highest self.“The person practicing svadhyaya reads his own book of life, at the same time that he writes and revises it.”- B.K.S. Iyengar, Light on YogaIsvara-pranidhana SurrenderGive your life force energy to something higher than yourself. This is devotion and surrenderfor the small self to the higher self. We practiceisvara-pranidhana every time we dedicate or offer up our yoga practice to someone else. This has apowerful effect on your practice. It creates new sense of purpose when your practice is infusedwith intention and energy. Isvara-pranidhana also means letting go of doubt and making room for faith.
