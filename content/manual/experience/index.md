Experience
271Breath MeditationFind a sitting position that allows you to be stable and grounded yet open and at ease. Close your eyes and establish a simple sense of presence. Now, allowing your awareness to scan through your body and, wherever possible, softening and releasing obvious areas of physical tension. You might take a few very full breaths, and then allow your breath to be natural. Bringing your attention to where you most easily detect the breath, or perhaps where it’s most pleasurable … letting this place of experiencing the breath be your home base, an anchor to the present moment. Noticing your breath … right here. Each time you notice that your mind has wandered off is a moment of mindfulness. Gently bringing your attention back to the inflow and outflow of the breath, offering a relaxed, wakeful presence. Continuing with this relaxed and calming attention on the breath … Each time the attention wanders and you notice, gently bringing it back. Like training the puppy … no judgment. Simply a kindly return. Sit. Stay. This breath, just now. If it’s helpful, you can notice the beginning, and middle, and ending of the in-breath or rise … and the beginning, and middle, and end of the out-breath or the fall … Notice the space between breaths … rest yourself … relaxing with the breathing. Sensing the breath in the foreground, still aware of the field of sensations in the background. You are learning to be centered, balanced, and present for the breath and the living world of sensation … wisely aware of this changing life. Take one more breath. Be aware of your whole body as best you can. Take a breath. And then when you’re ready, you can open your eyes. reflectionHow did you feel immediately after your meditation?What did you notice about your breath or body?

To appreciate the significance of the chakras, consider the location, elementand seed sound or bijamantra and the lotus or mandalathat is used to depict each one. The seed sound is to be chanted while a practitioner meditates on each chakra’s symbolism, whether it be through an energetic quality, a deity associated, an element, bodily organ, color, or shape to create an experience or grow awareness of each of the chakras. Chakras are also represented by lotuses, symbolizing the unfolding of flower petals, which metaphorically describe the opening of a chakra.Lotus flowers are sacred in India. Growing from mud, they symbolize a path of development from a primitive being to fully blossoming.The base chakra rooted in the earth evolves into the 1,000-petal lotus flower at the crown of the head!Through meditation or chanting of the seed sound and focus on the chakras, a practitioner connects to the energy or element of the chakras and awakens a path for prana to flow. We can then better understand ourselves, the world around us and the world within us. The seed sounds and elements of earth, water, fire, wind, space/ether are not just “places in [the] body…everything has one of the [seed] sounds and elements within them…and the spinal chord[is] a musical instrument to play these notes from” (Raja Choudhury).Once awakened or open, it is said that one’s kundalini (the sleeping serpent at the base of the spine) prana is awakened and there is a pathway to knowing our essential Self or ānanda(AAH-nun-duh), bliss. ©Yoga FlowYOGA

The Point of BalanceTHE HEART BRIDGE4th chakra -AnāhataChakra(ah-naa-huh-tuhchuck-ruh)The heart (the home of love and compassion) is the bridge between where experience shifts from me to we.The symbol of this chakra –two intersecting triangles, one pointing up and one pointing down --shows that it is the balance between the lower three chakras that represent our basic needs, and the higher chakras, that refer to the subtler energy chakras. THE UPPER THREE The upper three chakras correspond to thetranscendent nature of the human being:spoken truth or power of theword (throat chakra), intuition and wisdom (third eye chakra),and humilityand divinity (crown chakra
The lower triangle: Our need to feel seen, connected, have agency.The upper triangle:How we bring to life our higher level of consciousness and connection to our Self.The lower three: Our need to feel seen, connected, have agency, represented bythe first three chakras.The upper three:How we bring to life our higher level of consciousness and connection to our Self, represented by the upper three chakras
