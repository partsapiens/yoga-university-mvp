© C O RE P O W ER Y OG AWHY DO WE ASSIST?Assisting is a powerful way to connect and an efficient way to deliver information. Hands off and hands on assists provide i nformation for a student that they might not receive otherwise and can move their practice forward quic kly.WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO ASSIST IN PRACTICE?Assists support the student in learning something new in their practice. The learning might be through a visualdemonstration, a verbalinstruction or varying degreesof a physical touch assists from directional to deepening.THE GOALTo benefit others by supporting their evolution, understanding and execution of their yogapractice.THE IMPORTANCE OF TOUCHPsychology TodayOn May 28, 2024, a new article in Psychology Today sharethe meta-analysis research on the power of touch. As Polish psychologist Angieszka Sorokowska and colleagues found the following:-Touch is important for infant development as well asadult communication and well-being.-Touch deprivation is linked to a host of negative mentalhealth and behavioral outcomes.-Touch interventions are effective for improving bothphysical and mental health.The results revealed overall that touch interventions havethe largest benefits for anxiety, depression, fatigue andpain.NIHOn May 26, 2020, the National Institute of Health posted an article on the research of A. Heatley Tejada, et al. on physical contact and loneliness. The study found that the people receiving physical touch on a consistent basis reported lower levels of loneliness from studies going back to 2006.The Power of AssistsHarvard Med ical SchoolOn June 13, 2023, Harvard Medical School publisheda series of articles on the benefits of human touch.They found that Oxytocin can be released through touch, music and exercise. Oxytocin is a hormone that’s produced in the hypothalamus andreleased into the bloodstream by the pituitary gland. Oxytocin has been shown to decrease stress and anxiety levels.IMPORTANCE OF CONSENT TO TOUCHA SSUME OPTE D OU TAlways ask people to share their preference ontouch. Empowering yourstudents to share ifthey want to be touched with tokens or averbal/hand raise at the beginning of class is optimal. Assume people have opted out. If you haven’ t asked at the beginning of class, or ifyou have forgotten without the aid of token,ask before you touch. When in doubt, use ademonstration or a verbal assist to get theinformation a cross and then make a connectionafter class to offer the assist then.NON-PHYSICAL TOUCH ASSISTSVerb al/ Direction al/ Demo ns trationsThese assists can be done at any time andprovide powerful insights for students. You can point to an area on your own body,demonstrate a range of motions or postures.You can use your voice to bring awareness to a specific movement for the group or anindividual and that creates a mentalconnection.AVOID FORCING FLEXIBILITYW hy we rec om mend d e p th as s is ts rarelySports Medic in e M. D. Nathan Yokel presentedin an interview on August 25 , 2017, that“forcing a stretch, and worse having someoneelse force it on you, is asking for an injury that could do permanent damage. And while pain is one way of gauging the limits of our flexibility, it isn’t always the perfect guide because someareas have more sensation than other. Muscleshave more and tendons and ligamentshaveless. You might not necessarily feel it in thatmoment. Slow, static holds with breath overtime will move you to your optimum stateof flexibility.”4. 2

IntentionThe intention of an adjustment is to set the student up for success. Adjust or “assist” thestudent to foster proper and healthy alignment. All your intentions are transferred through your touch, the words you speak and your body language, so it should be pure and supportive.Breathe With ThemMatch your breath to the student’s breath. Also, breathe while you adjust, as it will help to protect you from injury.Ground DownBegin with the foundation and build upon that.Find your own grounded stance and work fromthat place. To provide a safe, confident assist, you must have a solid connection to the earth and your student.Know the AssistTeach and adjust only from your personalexperience. Know where you are going and how to get there. If you have not experienced aparticular adjustment, do not try it on a student. Always practice new adjustments on or with other instructors.DAPP This is a methodical way to approach poses and offer ways to customize four elements:1.Depth–the muscular effort of the pose, such as sitting back deeper in a pose2.Angle–a bone angle change, such as a soft bend in the knee 3.Prop –the use of a tool like a block, strap to enhance the pose or make it more accessible4.Pose –an alternative pose that has a similar intention but may look different or be more supportiveThere are multiple tools in your toolbox to support your students such as the four main types of assists and DAPP. Use all of these during your class to ensure your student feels successful. If offering touch, have a way to ask for consent, such as an assist token with a “yes/no” side.
THE APPROACHBe Present and ConfidentBe fully engaged in the posture with the student you are assisting. Keep your touch firm and grounded so that your student trusts that you are with them and so they will be safe in the assist. Assess and decide exactly how you will assist before you beginand approach confidently so thestudent trusts you.4. 3
