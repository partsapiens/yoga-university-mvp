## 6.1 History of Yoga — Overview

A concise, teacher‑friendly map of how yoga's ideas and practices evolved from early Vedic rituals to today's global movement. Use historically‑aware language and avoid over‑certain claims; dates are approximate.

## 6.2 Sankalpa — Heartfelt Intention

*Sankalpa* is an affirmative intention rooted in values, not outcomes. Use it to shape class theming and support consistent practice.

* Phrase in present tense: "I am…", "I choose…", "I embody…"
* Align with yamas/niyamas; revisit at Integration and Savasana.
* Keep it concise (one breath long) and repeatable.

## 6.3 Yoga Sutras of Patanjali

Short aphorisms (c. 2nd–5th century CE) codifying yoga's path. Key ideas:

* **Yogaś citta‑vṛtti‑nirodhaḥ** — stilling mental fluctuations.
* **Abhyāsa** (steady practice) + **Vairāgya** (non‑attachment).
* **Kleśas**: avidyā, asmitā, rāga, dveṣa, abhiniveśa.
* **Kriyā Yoga**: tapas, svādhyāya, Īśvara‑praṇidhāna.

## 6.4 What is Yoga?

From the Sanskrit root *yuj* — to yoke, join, or integrate. In practice: a method of aligning body, breath, mind, and values.

* **Process over posture**: yoga is a state and a path, not only shapes.
* **Four pillars in class**: intention, breath, attention, compassion.

## 6.5 Major Paths of Yoga

* **Jñāna** — study, inquiry, discernment.
* **Bhakti** — devotion, love, surrender.
* **Karma** — selfless action, service.
* **Rāja** — meditative path, often linked with the eight limbs.
* **Haṭha** — force/balance; physical + subtle techniques to steady the mind.

## 6.6 Key Texts

* **Upaniṣads** — philosophical dialogs on self and reality.
* **Bhagavad Gītā** — synthesis of paths; duty and devotion.
* **Yoga Sūtras** — concise framework for practice.
* **Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā** — medieval manual of techniques.

## 6.7 Historical Timeline

* **Vedic** (c. 1500–500 BCE): early ritual, hymn, and contemplative seeds.
* **Classical** (c. 200 BCE–500 CE): Sūtras period; codification.
* **Medieval** (c. 500–1500): Tantric/Haṭha developments.
* **Modern** (19th–21st c.): global diffusion; posture‑focused schools.

## 6.8 Lineages & Modern Schools

Notable 20th‑century teachers shaped modern asana: Krishnamacharya and students (Iyengar, Pattabhi Jois, Indra Devi), plus later innovators synthesizing vinyasa, alignment, and therapeutics.

## 6.9 Culture & Respectful Teaching

* Credit sources; avoid stereotyping or exoticizing traditions.
* Use inclusive, trauma‑aware language; offer opt‑outs.
* Honor cultural roots while teaching accessibly in your context.

## 6.10 Teacher Ethics (Overview)

* Clear boundaries and consent; power dynamics awareness.
* Ongoing education; refer out beyond scope.
* Equity: pricing transparency, accessibility, and community care.

## 6.11 The Eight‑Limb Path (Ashtanga)

1. Yama
2. Niyama
3. Asana
4. Pranayama
5. Pratyahara
6. Dharana
7. Dhyana
8. Samadhi

> See Chapter 5 for in‑depth treatment; this section emphasizes classroom integration.

## 6.12 Eight Limbs in Teaching Practice

Translate the eight-limb framework into clear classroom moves.

* **Yama/Niyama**: set theme; model language.
* **Asana**: scaffold options; emphasize stability before depth.
* **Pranayama**: simple count or cadence embedded in flow.
* **Pratyahara → Dhyana**: quiet transitions; longer savasana.

## 6.13 Yamas & Niyamas (Recap)

Apply as class themes and real‑life practices. Invite one actionable example per student each week.

> For definitions and icons, see Chapter 5 §§5.2–5.3. Here, focus on translation into cues and choices.

## 6.14 Meditation (Dhyana) — Essentials

Offer accessible meditation in every class: 2–5 minutes is enough to practice attention and ease.

* Anchor: breath, sound, or body sensation.
* Instructions: short, neutral, invitational.
* Normalize mind‑wandering; cue gentle return.

## 6.15 Mantra & Japa

Use sound as a focusing tool; keep participation optional and inclusive.

* Choose simple phrases (e. g., Om Shanti) or value‑based English mantras.
* Japa: quiet repetition, breath‑paced; beads optional.
* Invite resonance and rest after chanting.

## 6.16 Mudras — Hand Seals

Simple mudras can support breath and focus. Offer as optional refinements.

* **Jnana Mudra**: thumb + index touch; rest fingers long.
* **Hridaya Mudra**: ring finger + thumb; index at base of thumb.
* **Anjali Mudra**: palms together at heart; steady breath.

## 6.17 Sanskrit Basics for Teachers

* Pronunciation: short vs. long vowels (a/ā, i/ī, u/ū), retroflex consonants (ṭ, ḍ, ṇ).
* Common pose endings: *‑āsana* (posture), *uttāna* (intense stretch), *parivṛtta* (revolved).
* Use both English & Sanskrit names; keep tone inclusive and clear.

## 6.18 Using Sanskrit in Class

Keep Sanskrit supportive, not performative. Prioritize clarity and accessibility.

* Give English + Sanskrit on first mention; then use one consistently.
* Translate metaphors; avoid literalism that confuses students.
* Invite corrections from community members; model humility.

## 6.19 Pranayama

* **Ujjāyī**: gentle constriction at glottis; oceanic sound.
* **Nādī Śodhana**: alternate nostril breathing; balance channels.
* **Kumbhaka**: breath retention; apply with care.

## 6.20 Breath & Nervous System

Frame breath work as a way to regulate arousal and attention. Offer inclusive options and avoid medical claims.

* Longer, slower exhales can support relaxation for many students.
* Box or ladder breathing to practice steady pacing.
* Always allow opt‑out and rest; skip retentions for those who prefer.

## 6.21 Coherent Breathing (Even Ratio)

Even‑length inhales and exhales (e. g., 5:5) can help many students feel steadier. Keep it gentle and optional.

* Start with 4:4 for new students; increase only if comfortable.
* Use silent counting or soft metronome‑like cues.

## 6.22 Box & Ladder Breathing

Structured counts that build pacing and awareness.

* **Box**: inhale–hold–exhale–hold (e. g., 4‑4‑4‑4). Skip holds as needed.
* **Ladder**: step counts up (4→6→8) then down.

## 6.23 Breath–Movement Linking

Coordinate breath and movement to cultivate focus and rhythm in practice.

* One movement per breath; pause at transitions.
* Inhale for lifting, opening, backbending; exhale for folding, twisting, forward folds.
* Cue breath first, then movement; respect individual pace.

## 6.24 Breathwork Cautions & Adaptations

Create safe, inclusive breath practices that honor individual needs and limitations.

* Never force breath retention; offer natural pauses instead.
* Avoid intense pranayama for pregnancy, anxiety, or respiratory conditions.
* Cue "breathe normally" as default; advanced techniques are optional add-ons.
* Model calm, steady breathing yourself throughout class.

## 6.25 Kumbhaka (Breath Retention) — Optional

Advanced breath retention practices. Offer only to experienced students with clear cautions.

* **Antara Kumbhaka**: retention after inhale (use sparingly).
* **Bahya Kumbhaka**: retention after exhale (gentler option).
* Start with natural pauses; never strain or force.

> Skip this section for beginners, pregnancy, anxiety, or any breathing difficulties.

## 6.26 Sound & Breath (Nāda Yoga)

Explore the vibrational aspects of breath and voice as meditation tools.

* **Humming**: simple, accessible sound vibration.
* **Ujjāyī**: ocean-like sound created at the throat.
* **Chanting**: longer sound practices with traditional or modern phrases.

## 6.27 Bandhas

The Bandhas are energetic locks that help to control and direct the flow of prana (life force energy) within the body. When taught skillfully, they can create a feeling of lightness, stability, and power.

*   **Mula Bandha** (Root Lock): This is a gentle lifting of the pelvic floor muscles.
    *   **Deeper Explanation:** Think of it less as a forceful clench and more as the feeling of lifting up from the very base of your spine. It creates a stable foundation for your posture and prevents energy from "leaking" out.
    *   **Cueing Tip:** "Imagine a gentle lifting sensation at the base of your pelvis, like you're trying to pick up a small pebble with your pelvic floor muscles."
*   **Uddiyana Bandha** (Upward Flying Lock): This is the drawing of the abdominal wall in and up.
    *   **Deeper Explanation:** This bandha tones and strengthens the core, supports the lower back, and stokes the digestive fire (Agni). It is most safely practiced on an empty stomach.
    *   **Cueing Tip:** "On your next exhale, gently draw your navel in towards your spine and slightly up. Feel how this supports your lower back."
*   **Jalandhara Bandha** (Chin Lock): This is the lengthening of the back of the neck and the slight tucking of the chin.
    *   **Deeper Explanation:** This bandha is often used in formal pranayama and meditation. It helps to regulate the flow of energy to the head and can have a calming effect on the nervous system.
    *   **Cueing Tip:** "Lengthen through the back of your neck and gently guide your chin towards your chest, without creating any tension in the front of your throat."

## 6.28 Chakras — Subtle Body Map

The Chakras are a system for understanding the subtle body. They can be thought of as spinning vortexes of energy that correspond to major nerve plexuses in the physical body. We can use the chakra system as a map for self-inquiry and as a tool for creating themed classes.

*   **Teaching with the Chakras:** When theming a class around a chakra, you are not trying to "fix" or "unblock" it. You are simply inviting awareness to a particular area of the body and its associated psycho-emotional qualities.
*   **Class Example (Heart Chakra - Anahata):**
    *   **Intention:** "Today's practice is an invitation to connect with the qualities of the heart chakra: compassion, connection, and unconditional love."
    *   **Asana:** Focus on heart-opening poses like Cobra, Upward-Facing Dog, Camel, and Bridge Pose.
    *   **Pranayama:** Practice a simple, heart-centered breath, imagining you are breathing in and out of your heart space.
    *   **Meditation:** A loving-kindness meditation, where you send well wishes to yourself and others.

## 6.29 Nadis (Ida • Pingala • Sushumna)

Energy channels in yogic anatomy. Three main nadis provide framework for breath practice and balance.

* **Ida**: left nostril, lunar, cooling, receptive energy.
* **Pingala**: right nostril, solar, warming, active energy.
* **Sushumna**: central channel, balance, integration.
