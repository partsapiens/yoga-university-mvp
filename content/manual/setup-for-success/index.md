# Setup for Success

Welcome to your yoga teacher training journey! This chapter will help you establish the foundation for a transformative and successful learning experience.

## Creating Your Learning Environment

### Physical Space
Your practice space is sacred. Whether at home or in the studio, create an environment that supports focus and growth:

Approach your training with intention and openness:

- **Set clear intentions**: Why are you here? What do you hope to gain?
- **Embrace beginner's mind**: Be open to new perspectives and approaches
