## 5.1 Eight Limbs of Yoga

Outlined by Sage Patanjali, the eight limbs provide a map for holistic practice and spiritual growth:

1. **Yama** — ethical disciplines
2. **Niyama** — personal observances
3. **Asana** — physical posture
4. **Pranayama** — breath regulation
5. **Pratyahara** — withdrawal of senses
6. **Dharana** — concentration
7. **Dhyana** — meditation
8. **Samadhi** — integration / bliss

## 5.2 Yamas — Ethical Restraints

The Yamas are a set of ethical principles that guide our interactions with the world. They are not commandments, but invitations to practice.

*   **Ahimsa** (Non-harming): This extends beyond physical violence to include our words, thoughts, and actions towards ourselves and others.
    *   **Class Theme Example:** A class focused on Ahimsa might emphasize self-compassion, honoring the body's limits, and moving with kindness.
    *   **Reflection Prompt:** Where can I be kinder to myself today?
*   **Satya** (Truthfulness): This means speaking and living our truth with compassion.
    *   **Class Theme Example:** A class focused on Satya might explore poses that feel authentic and true to the student's body, rather than striving for an external shape.
    *   **Reflection Prompt:** Is there a truth I need to acknowledge, either to myself or to someone else?
*   **Asteya** (Non-stealing): This includes not taking what is not freely given, including someone else's time, energy, or peace of mind.
    *   **Class Theme Example:** A class focused on Asteya could be about being content with your own practice and not "stealing" glances at others to compare.
    *   **Reflection Prompt:** In what ways can I practice being content with what I have right now?
*   **Brahmacharya** (Wise use of energy): Traditionally translated as celibacy, in modern yoga it is often interpreted as directing our energy wisely and avoiding excess.
    *   **Class Theme Example:** A class focused on Brahmacharya might involve a slow, mindful flow, conserving energy and making every movement count.
    *   **Reflection Prompt:** Where am I leaking energy in my life, and how can I redirect it?
*   **Aparigraha** (Non-grasping): This is the practice of letting go of attachment to outcomes, possessions, and even identities.
    *   **Class Theme Example:** A class focused on Aparigraha might end with a longer Savasana, practicing the art of letting go completely.
    *   **Reflection Prompt:** What is one thing I am holding onto that no longer serves me?

## 5.3 Niyamas — Observances

The Niyamas are a set of personal practices that cultivate a positive inner world.

*   **Shaucha** (Purity/Clarity): This refers to the cleanliness of our bodies, minds, and environments.
    *   **Class Theme Example:** A class focused on Shaucha might incorporate twisting poses, which are thought to have a cleansing effect on the internal organs.
    *   **Reflection Prompt:** What is one small action I can take to create more clarity in my space or my mind?
*   **Santosha** (Contentment): This is the practice of finding joy and gratitude for what is, right here and now.
    *   **Class Theme Example:** A gratitude-themed class, where students are invited to bring to mind things they are thankful for during the practice.
    *   **Reflection Prompt:** What are three things I am grateful for in this moment?
*   **Tapas** (Discipline): This is the inner fire that fuels our practice and helps us burn through obstacles.
    *   **Class Theme Example:** A challenging class with a focus on holding poses for a longer duration, building heat and resilience.
    *   **Reflection Prompt:** What is one healthy habit I can commit to with discipline this week?
*   **Svadhyaya** (Self-study): This is the practice of self-inquiry, of turning our awareness inward to understand ourselves better.
    *   **Class Theme Example:** A practice with periods of silence, allowing students to notice their own thoughts and patterns.
    *   **Reflection Prompt:** What is one pattern of thought or behavior I have noticed in myself recently?
*   **Ishvara Pranidhana** (Surrender): This means surrendering the fruits of our practice to something larger than ourselves, whether that is a deity, the universe, or our own highest self.
    *   **Class Theme Example:** A class that ends with a dedication, where students are invited to offer the energy of their practice to someone or something.
    *   **Reflection Prompt:** What would it feel like to trust and surrender in a challenging situation I am currently facing?

## 5.4 Yoga Sutras — Key Concepts

Patanjali's Yoga Sutras are a collection of 196 aphorisms that provide a roadmap for the practice of yoga. They are less of a "how-to" manual and more of a philosophical framework.

*   **Chitta Vritti Nirodha (Sutra 1.2):** "Yoga is the stilling of the fluctuations of the mind." This is the most famous definition of yoga. It tells us that the ultimate goal of our practice is not a perfect handstand, but a calm and clear mind.
    *   **Cueing Tip:** In Savasana, you might say, "Allow your thoughts to come and go, like clouds in the sky. Your awareness is the still, blue sky behind them."
*   **Abhyasa & Vairagya (Sutra 1.12):** This sutra states that the stilling of the mind is achieved through practice (Abhyasa) and non-attachment (Vairagya). These are the two wings of the bird of yoga; we need both to fly.
    *   **Cueing Tip:** "Find the balance between effort and ease in this pose. The effort is your practice, the ease is your non-attachment."
*   **Kleshas:** The Sutras identify five root causes of our suffering: ignorance of our true nature, ego, attachment to pleasure, aversion to pain, and fear of death. Our yoga practice helps us to see these Kleshas more clearly and to lessen their grip on us.
*   **Kriya Yoga:** The yoga of action. Patanjali outlines a three-part path for the householder yogi: Tapas (discipline), Svadhyaya (self-study), and Ishvara Pranidhana (surrender). This is the practical application of yoga in our daily lives.

## 5.5 Yogic Lifestyle & Modern Practice

Living a yogic lifestyle means carrying the principles of our practice off the mat and into our daily lives. It's about creating a life that is in alignment with our values.

*   **Mindful Consumption:** This applies not just to food, but to what we consume with our senses: the media we watch, the music we listen to, the conversations we engage in.
*   **Aligning Relationships:** Practice Ahimsa in your communication with your loved ones. Practice Satya by being authentic. Practice Asteya by respecting their time and energy.
*   **Daily Ritual:** Create small, consistent rituals, like a 5-minute morning meditation or a moment of gratitude before meals. This infuses your day with intention.
*   **Seva (Selfless Service):** Find a way to be of service to your community without expecting anything in return. This could be volunteering, helping a neighbor, or simply offering a listening ear.

> Yoga is a lifelong, evolving practice — both inner discipline and outward compassion.

#### Case Study: Applying Aparigraha Off the Mat

A student named Maria is frustrated because she is not making progress in her career as quickly as she would like. She is attached to a specific outcome and timeline.
*   **The Practice:** During a yoga class themed around Aparigraha (non-grasping), she is invited to let go of her attachment to achieving a "perfect" pose and to simply be with the process.
*   **The Insight:** This on-the-mat practice gives her an insight. She realizes she has been "grasping" for a promotion in the same way she was grasping for a deeper forward fold.
*   **The Action:** Maria decides to practice Aparigraha in her career. She continues to do her best work (Abhyasa), but she lets go of her attachment to a specific outcome (Vairagya). This shift in mindset reduces her stress and allows her to find more joy in her daily work, which ironically, leads to new opportunities.
