WHY Having a sankalpagives you a clear reason to guide your efforts, actions and choices. With all the changes in the world, our families, our friends, our roles, our projects, a sankalpabecomes a constant and allows our most meaningful project to be ourselves.WHAT Sankalpais a yogic formula which combines your truth with your resolve.“Kalpa” means "vow," like a vow one would make with another at marriage or a vow one asks another for at the end of life. “San” refers to our connection with our truth. It is beyond a resolution by the nature of its inherent truth. Truth exists in the past, present, and future and transcends time. That’s why most sankalpasare written in the now (I am, or I exist) vs a resolution for the future (I will).There are 2 common types of sankalpas:Heartfelt desire:A simple statement of “I am _____” --you at your most inspiredSpecific intention:A simple statement of “I exist to ____” of your life’s mission.One can evolve into anotherand they can merge.Ultimately, it is a promise from you, to you, to be you.
