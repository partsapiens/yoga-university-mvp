joint movement.EFFICIENCY OF MOVEMENT Efficiency of movement occurs when using theleast amount of physical, metabolic, and mental effort (energy) with each movement. Movements performed with increased mechanical efficiency can become seemingly effortless. In any physicalactivity, yoga included, muscle coordination is a key factor for increased movement efficiency.Movement efficiency decreases with unnecessary increased muscle action inconsistent with thedirection of motion (decreased movementcoordination). For example, swinging your arms side-to-side while running forward increasesmuscle action but is not necessary to increase your desired forward motion; therefore, decreasingefficiency of the forward movement. Whereas, minimizing the side-to-side movement andcoordinating movement and muscle action in the forward direction would serve to increasemovement efficiency. Moving inefficiently uses more energy and expands more effort, likelydecreasing the amount of time available toparticipate in the activity and contributing to a person’s decreased overall sense of success.In yoga postures, it is important to understand the overall intention of the pose (which area should be working vs. relaxed), and understand overall muscle action to facilitate maximum efficiency, balancedenergy expenditure, increased participation duration, and enhanced sense of success.

Understanding neutral is how we learn to read for alignment and misalignment in our students. To find your own, stand up straight, extend your arms at your sides, face your palms forward.Establish a Firm Base in Your Feet- Press through all four corners of your feet- Evenly distribute your body weight- Spread all ten toes. Relax your toes to the floor without gripping- Lift up through the arches of your feet to engage your legsStack Your
