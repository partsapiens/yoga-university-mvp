# Music and Yoga

Music is a form of yoga—Nada yoga, or the yoga of sound. Nada yoga is a way to approach music with reverence. Music in this context is more than justsomething you like or don’t like. It becomes a way to create harmony between your inner and outer world. Music can be very influential in setting the tone for a class. To begin forming your first playlist, startlistening with intention and reverence. Take yogaclasses from a variety of teachers and note of how different music affects you and your practice. Ifthe teacher is comfortable sharing their music, collect artists and songs from their playlist. On your first playlist, start slow. You will have a lot to manage in the classroom in your first fewclasses. A playlist ideally adds to the atmosphere of a class in a positive way. If you feel you need to turn your music down, because it is distracting, that is a good sign that you need to change your playlist. It’s highly recommended that you startout with a predominately instrumental or ambient mix. CREATE A PLAYLIST Great playlists create a mood or tone of harmony and follows the intensity of class. A good place to start is instrumental or ambient music on Spotify or iTunes. Try Lifescapes, Buddha Bar, Yoga Fit or Putumayo Presents. Once you are comfortable in the classroom and are ready for more creativity, try Pandora to find new artists or YouTube tocheck out songs you hear on the radio, TV, movies or elsewhere. To get started, take each section of your sequence and define the intensity level of the physical poses. What type of songs would work for each section? What qualities of music would aid this sectionof the sequence? You’ll want to create an order or sequence of songs that match the intensity of each section. Try starting with calmer songs, build the energy to a climax and then come back to calm music. Use the different tempos of music to create amusic sequence that follows the flow of your class. Create smooth transitions from one song to thenext—consider whether one song builds to the next or drops off too dramatically. Listen to a song all the way through beforechoosing to put it on a playlist. Pay attention to the lyrics—ask yourself, “Are they appropriatelyrics for a yoga setting?” If not, skip it. Remember a playlist is an act of service to your students’practice, not only about what you like. Now take the lists you have made and begin tocraft a playlist for your basic sequence of poses. Play the music as you practice the full class. How did it feel? What worked and didn’t work? Makeadjustments until you have a playlist that matches the intensity and intention for each section of your class.

# Transition Pose: IN –Mountain PoseEX –Hot Half Moon Pose

Sequencing BasicsA Transition Pose is a pose that occurs right before the pose you are in. It often shares key alignment principles or posture similarities.
A Preview Pose is a foundational pose that consists of posture similarities and key alignment principles necessary to build up to your Focus Pose or Muscle Focus. When used in sequencing, these two concepts support the understanding of safe transitions and the sequencing of poses based on similarities rather than differences. This is also known as vinyasa krama or intelligent sequencing.
Transition Pose: IN –Mountain PoseEX –Hot Half Moon Pose
Preview Pose: IN –Crescent MoonFocus Pose: IN –Wheel PoseWhen sequencing, build from the C1 template with the added ability to add intelligent intensity, new postures, and add progressions or layers. As you consider building a new sequence, review the Series Intention and work with a Focus Pose or Muscle Focus. Includeall7movementsofthe spine: - Flexion/extension –bend forward and back- Rotation left/right–twist side to side- Lateral flexion left/right –bend side to side- Axial extension –decompress(lengthen) yourspineBest PracticesPlace postures next to each other based on similarity instead of difference (see Transition and Preview Pose). Postures should be placed to help build a skillset for postures later in the sequence and prepares the body for complex postures without overly fatiguing. Blueprint Postures also serve as the foundation of your sequence. TransitionsMoving from one pose to another requires well-cued and thought out transitions. In Vinyasa, we use the breath to support movement. Typically, when we move away from the ground or expand, we inhale. When moving towards the ground or contracting, we exhale. In addition, when sequencing change no more than 2 major body positions per transition. For example: Ideal: Inhale Crescent Lunge àExhale Warrior 2 Requires a change in1. Leg and pelvis position with heel down2. Torso position to face the side Not ideal: Exhale Prayer Twist àInhale/Exhale Warrior 2 Requires a change in1. Leg position from together to apart2. Pelvis position from facing forward to facing side3. Change in hip and knee flexion4. Spine position from twist to neutral2.19© Yoga Flow YOGA

AGONIST, ANTAGONIST REVIEW Agonists and Synergists muscles contract short or flex (concentric) and Antagonist contract long or stretch (eccentric). Your cues can emphasize the Muscle Focus or benefit of a posture. For example: Spinal Extension or Backbends- Agonist: RhomboidsMAC: Squeeze your shoulder blades to lift your chest more and open your chest- Synergists: Trapezius MAC: Lean back evenly across your upper back to evenly distribute your backbend- Antagonist: Transverse AbsMAC: Wrap your deep core to create stability in your backbendYou can use a Focus Pose to highlight actions in your sequence. For example: Dancer’s Pose- Agonist: Glutes MAC: Extend your lifted heel up and back to fire up your glutes- Synergists: Hamstring and LatsMAC: Press your back heel back and up to lift your leg higher MAC: Draw your back elbow into the midline to turn on your lats- Antagonist: Transverse AbsMAC: Knit the front of your ribs to anchor your backbend
