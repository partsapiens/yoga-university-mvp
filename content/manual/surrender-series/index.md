WHAT IS A THEME? A theme can complete a class experience and create a mind body experience. Themes are universal and connect the physical practice and postures to life beyond the physical. One word or short phrase that is consistent through the practice may be explained in many different wayswith theme-inspired verbs, cues, metaphors or imagery. Choose a philosophical learning or a learning that is present to you.

VINYASA Vinyasa is a three-part Sanskrit word: ”vi” and “ny” and “asa” can be translated to mean “placement in a specific way” or to “place in a special way.” Vinyasa or vinyasa krama is intentional placement and sequencing of postures. One example is the placement of postures based on their similarities: Mountain Pose followed by Forward Fold both share leg orientation. Another is the placement of postures based on their breath: inhale postures followed by exhale postures.

THE HIPS What we call the hips includes multiple muscle groups that support your foundation, ability to stand upright, move, walk, run and do yoga asana (poses). Though the hips series only includes one posture, it is impactful. Muscles that vary in size and function such as the glutes, adductors, abductors, hip flexors, and piriformis to name a few, are affected when we do hip opening postures like half pigeon.
