3 .22 © Yoga Flow YOGA Identify neutral alignmentIntroduce a themeInvite students to set an intention
WHAT IS A THEME? A theme can complete a class experience and create a mind body experience. Themes are universal and connect the physical practice and postures to life beyond the physical. One word or short phrase that is consistent through the practice may be explained in many different wayswith theme-inspired verbs, cues, metaphors or imagery. Choose a philosophical learning or a learning that is present to you.

VINYASA Vinyasa is a three-part Sanskrit word: ”vi” and “ny” and “asa” can be translated to mean “placement in a specific way” or to “place in a special way.” Vinyasa or vinyasa krama is intentional placement and sequencing of postures. One example is the placement of postures based on their similarities: Mountain Pose followed by Forward Fold both share leg orientation. Another is the placement of postures based on their breath: inhale postures followed by exhale postures.

3. 9 0© Yoga Flow YOGA Stretch your hip muscle while they are warm from the standing seriesOpen your hips before backbends
THE HIPS What we call the hips includes multiple muscle groups that support your foundation, ability to stand upright, move, walk, run and do yoga asana (poses). Though the hips series only includes one posture, it is impactful. Muscles that vary in size and function such as the glutes, adductors, abductors, hip flexors, and piriformis to name a few, are affected when we do hip opening postures like half pigeon.

© C O RE P O W ER Y OG AWHY DO WE ASSIST?Assisting is a powerful way to connect and an efficient way to deliver information. Hands off and hands on assists provide i nformation for a student that they might not receive otherwise and can move their practice forward quic kly.WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO ASSIST IN PRACTICE?Assists support the student in learning something new in their practice. The learning might be through a visualdemonstration, a verbalinstruction or varying degreesof a physical touch assists from directional to deepening.THE GOAL To benefit others by supporting their evolution, understanding and execution of their yogapractice.THE IMPORTANCE OF TOUCH Psychology TodayOn May 28, 2024, a new article in Psychology Today sharethe meta-analysis research on the power of touch. As Polish psychologist Angieszka Sorokowska and colleagues found the following:- Touch is important for infant development as well asadult communication and well-being.- Touch deprivation is linked to a host of negative mentalhealth and behavioral outcomes.- Touch interventions are effective for improving bothphysical and mental health.The results revealed overall that touch interventions havethe largest benefits for anxiety, depression, fatigue andpain.NIH On May 26, 2020, the National Institute of Health posted an article on the research of A. Heatley Tejada, et al. on physical contact and loneliness. The study found that the people receiving physical touch on a consistent basis reported lower levels of loneliness from studies going back to 2006.The Power of AssistsHarvard Med ical SchoolOn June 13, 2023, Harvard Medical School publisheda series of articles on the benefits of human touch.They found that Oxytocin can be released through touch, music and exercise. Oxytocin is a hormone that’s produced in the hypothalamus andreleased into the bloodstream by the pituitary gland. Oxytocin has been shown to decrease stress and anxiety levels.IMPORTANCE OF CONSENT TO TOUCHA SSUME OPTE D OU TAlways ask people to share their preference ontouch. Empowering yourstudents to share ifthey want to be touched with tokens or averbal/hand raise at the beginning of class is optimal. Assume people have opted out. If you haven’ t asked at the beginning of class, or ifyou have forgotten without the aid of token,ask before you touch. When in doubt, use ademonstration or a verbal assist to get theinformation a cross and then make a connectionafter class to offer the assist then.NON-PHYSICAL TOUCH ASSISTS Verb al/ Direction al/ Demo ns trationsThese assists can be done at any time andprovide powerful insights for students. You can point to an area on your own body,demonstrate a range of motions or postures.You can use your voice to bring awareness to a specific movement for the group or anindividual and that creates a mentalconnection.AVOID FORCING FLEXIBILITYW hy we rec om mend d e p th as s is ts rarelySports Medic in e M. D. Nathan Yokel presentedin an interview on August 25 , 2017, that“forcing a stretch, and worse having someoneelse force it on you, is asking for an injury that could do permanent damage. And while pain is one way of gauging the limits of our flexibility, it isn’t always the perfect guide because someareas have more sensation than other. Muscleshave more and tendons and ligamentshaveless. You might not necessarily feel it in thatmoment. Slow, static holds with breath overtime will move you to your optimum stateof flexibility.”4. 2

© Yoga Flow YOGA TYPES OF ASSISTS1.Verbal–verbal cues such as general form cues or muscle action cues 2.Directional–language that refers to landmarks in the room or space or using gestures to highlight areas of the student’s mat 3.Physical–hands on touch that supports their Form, Balanced Muscle Action and Student Directed Depth4.Demo–poses that you as a teacher will show in the front or sides of the room Honor that trust by knowing what you want to accomplish with themand:- Be mindful of your own alignment and safety while assisting.- Enterthestudent’sspacewithconfidenceand anintentionofkindness.- Makeaneffort to toucheveryoneinclass.- Assistthosewhoneedthemosthelpfirst.- Assistinawaythatcreatessupportand stabilityforthe student.DAPP and Principles of Assists
IntentionThe intention of an adjustment is to set the student up for success. Adjust or “assist” thestudent to foster proper and healthy alignment. All your intentions are transferred through your touch, the words you speak and your body language, so it should be pure and supportive.Breathe With ThemMatch your breath to the student’s breath. Also, breathe while you adjust, as it will help to protect you from injury.Ground DownBegin with the foundation and build upon that.Find your own grounded stance and work fromthat place. To provide a safe, confident assist, you must have a solid connection to the earth and your student.Know the AssistTeach and adjust only from your personalexperience. Know where you are going and how to get there. If you have not experienced aparticular adjustment, do not try it on a student. Always practice new adjustments on or with other instructors.DAPP This is a methodical way to approach poses and offer ways to customize four elements:1.Depth–the muscular effort of the pose, such as sitting back deeper in a pose2.Angle–a bone angle change, such as a soft bend in the knee 3.Prop –the use of a tool like a block, strap to enhance the pose or make it more accessible4.Pose –an alternative pose that has a similar intention but may look different or be more supportiveThere are multiple tools in your toolbox to support your students such as the four main types of assists and DAPP. Use all of these during your class to ensure your student feels successful. If offering touch, have a way to ask for consent, such as an assist token with a “yes/no” side.
THE APPROACH Be Present and ConfidentBe fully engaged in the posture with the student you are assisting. Keep your touch firm and grounded so that your student trusts that you are with them and so they will be safe in the assist. Assess and decide exactly how you will assist before you beginand approach confidently so thestudent trusts you.4. 3

NEC Kparticularly in Shoulder Stand and Bridge PoseMake sure that once up in the pose, the student does not turn his or her head from side to side. This can twist and aggravate the cervical spine.LOWER BACK and LUMBA Rparticularly in forward bendsLower back pain can be a problem when the body is not sufficiently warmed up or open.If the hamstring muscles are tight, work withpostures that gently loosen the hamstrings before attempting strong forward bends.LOWER BAC Kparticularly in backbendsLower back pain can be a problem if done when the body is not sufficiently warmed up or open.Teach backbends in stages and only practice full backbends and advanced versions if students aresufficiently open in the hip flexors, chest, shoulder and spine.KNEE STRAIN If the hips are not open, the knees and eventhe ankles will take the strain. As a precaution,practice hip opening postures before deep flexion of the knees.HAMSTRINGS The hamstrings can be injured in forward bends and hip opening postures. With minor tears it isbest to continue working the area to keep mobility and encourage healing. Other tears require restand then gentle stretching into the area.WRISTS The wrists can become sore and swollen when applying pressure in poses such as Downward Facing Dog. This usually indicates weak wrist muscles; as practice continues, the wrists will strengthen and the pain will pass.Common Physical ChallengesSHOULDERS The student can feel pain in the shoulders if thethoracic spine is rotated somewhere around T4 or T5. It is best to refer a student to a professional to have the spine and shoulders checked.TIP Encourage your students to know the difference between “good” pain and “bad” pain and to use deep, full breathing to release naturally rather than pushing and straining.

4.19 © Yoga Flow YOGA A contraindication is a factor that makes a yoga technique inadvisable. Many students will come to class with specific injuries or ailments. As aninstructor, it is important that we are able to accommodate them to the best of our ability.Please be aware of people’s conditions, and use your knowledge of the body to be responsive to individual needs.Ironically enough, the poses that may be mostdifficult for people with injuries may also be theones that help them the most when they’re on the road to recovery.INVERSIONS Any pose where the heart is above the head should not be attempted by those with:- High blood pressure- Low blood pressure- Glaucoma or any type of eye trauma- Any type of heart diseaseKNEE INJURIES Avoid any poses that bring the knee to less than a 90 degree angle and always maintain precise alignment of the knee.HIP REPLACEMENT / INJURIES Be extremely careful bringing the leg across the midline,and be very careful with any type of hip- opening poses, including the warrior poses and pigeon poses.SHOULDER INJURIES Avoid any type of arm strengthening poses,especially Chaturanga Dandasana. Depending on the degree of the injury, range of motion couldeven be limited as far as an inability to lift the arm very far away from the body.LOW BACK INJURIES If the injury resides in the sacrum, advise the student to maintain a flat back on any type ofContraindicationsforward fold. If the injury resides in the lumbar spine, limit backbends potentially only to Cobra or variations of Shalabasana. Fifty percent of Americans have lower back injuries - be verycareful and attentive to people’s needs.PREGNANCY Pregnant women should avoid:- Compression of belly - rounding in forward folds, core work, pulling belly up and in, etc.- Twisting postures closing off the pelvis - Seated Twist, Reverse Half Moon- Revolved Crescent Lunge- Lying on back for too long- Lying on belly- Full Up Dog when belly is too large- Heat – use caution at least for the first trimester- Jumping forwardThese postures can help:- Vertical Frog – any opening of the pelvis and front hips will help with childbirth- Wide legged forward folds - opening of the hips- Gentle Backbends – Standing Backbend, Camel, Dancers/Standing Bow- High and Side Plank – modified or full posture- Child’s Pose – wide-legged- Eagle – Helps facilitate movement of thelymphatic system to promote immunity and decrease swelling of jointsNotes on Prenatal FlowThe following list of postures is a guide based on the basic C1 Class. Please listen to your body and know that you are your own best teacher. Move slowly and with awareness in and out of postures as you would in any yoga class. You will hear themessages from your body in different ways than you may have in the past. Acknowledge those messages and honor your body. Fatigue may be a factor for you. If you feel as though you need a rest, take it. Remember, this is not only about you, this is alsoabout your baby. Balance may come and go depending on the day. Experiment with your postures, noticing whether you feel unstable. If so, back down for the day. It is much better to err on the side of caution than to put your baby at risk.

5.2 © Yoga Flow YOGA THE PHYSICAL BODY Dynamic activities like yoga increase bloodflow through the body, which heats and loosens connective tissue. Heat enhances the tissue’sability to soften and relax so it is beneficial to stretch after the muscles have been warmedup. Due to the nature and characteristics of the connective tissue, a yoga practice can target onearea of the body, while positively affecting another area.With the complementary muscular length andstrength benefits of yoga, a balanced yoga practice can improve posture and structural alignment bybalancing the muscular and soft-tissue tension pulling on opposite sides of a joint. Yoga helps tobuild multi-joint coordination, and with increasedpull at muscle-tendon-bone attachment sites, yoga can increase a person’s bone density.ALIGNMENTA basic knowledge of bone and muscle alignment, as well as how to stack the joints, is essential for injury prevention in yoga. A simple understanding of bone/muscle function and joint placementteaches efficiency in yoga and effortlessness of movement. By using proper alignment techniques to create efficiency of movement, yoga has many wonderful physiological effects on the body.Improper alignment causes undue stress on the body. Distortion of the joints can result in joint degeneration, and excessive load to supportingstructures (tendons, ligaments, cartilage, menisci). With repeated improper alignment and isolated or imbalanced excessive loading patterns, ligaments can overstretch, joint capsules can loosen andcartilage may wear out over time.Forward-head posture is currently one of the mostcommon abnormal postures in our society and occurs when a person’s head position is shifted forward relative toAnatomy is more than just the sum of all of the parts and systems of the body. While the body is perfect, the science of anatomy is imperfect.It lacks depth and dynamic relationship between the systems of the body and the individuality of each of us. The information provided here is abrief introduction to the physical make-up of the body. Understanding the functional anatomy,or relationship of how the body moves through yoga asana helps us understand the body moreintimately and opens our minds to the magnificent interplay of our physical beings.A basic knowledge and functional understanding of anatomical structures allows an instructor tosafely guide students in and out of yoga postures, while respecting natural skeletal joint structure, function, range of motion and muscle lengths;honoring structural integrity and facilitating injury prevention.Translated, vinyasa literally means “to place in a special way” or “to move with intention.”Together, a functional understanding of anatomy and appreciation for the physical intention of the yoga posture provides an instructor the abilityto skillfully personalize or modify a posture for a student with a physical limitation or injury, while staying aligned with the overall physical intention of the pose. This knowledgeable andmindful instructor facilitates a safe and successful yoga experience for the student. In addition,understanding the skeletal system’s structuralintegrity, the physical intention of the poses and exercises and the behavior of the anatomicalstructures involved in achieving a given pose or exercise, allows a teacher to choose verbal cuesthat strengthen a student’s awareness, alignment and connection to the asana. Understandinganatomy is paramount to educated body-reading and cueing as a teacher.Anatomy In Yoga

5 .3 PLANES OF MOTION All basic movements of the body take place inthese three planes of movement and the starting point is the neutral anatomical position.Sagittal PlaneVertical plane that divides the body into left and right, creates forward and backward movement
Frontal PlaneVertical plane that divides the body into front and back, creates side to side movement
Transverse PlaneDivides the body into top and bottom halves, often a twisting movement
their cervical spine. Ideal alignment of the head and neck positions the head stacked directly over the cervical bones of the neck. As the head shifts forward, the neck extensor muscles must work harder to keep the head and visionupright. Over time, the increased chronic stress of those muscles can lead to neck and back pain, TMJ, headaches and eventually disc degeneration, arthritis and decreased cervical spine joint movement.EFFICIENCY OF MOVEMENT Efficiency of movement occurs when using theleast amount of physical, metabolic, and mental effort (energy) with each movement. Movements performed with increased mechanical efficiency can become seemingly effortless. In any physicalactivity, yoga included, muscle coordination is a key factor for increased movement efficiency.Movement efficiency decreases with unnecessary increased muscle action inconsistent with thedirection of motion (decreased movementcoordination). For example, swinging your arms side-to-side while running forward increasesmuscle action but is not necessary to increase your desired forward motion; therefore, decreasingefficiency of the forward movement. Whereas, minimizing the side-to-side movement andcoordinating movement and muscle action in the forward direction would serve to increasemovement efficiency. Moving inefficiently uses more energy and expands more effort, likelydecreasing the amount of time available toparticipate in the activity and contributing to a person’s decreased overall sense of success.In yoga postures, it is important to understand the overall intention of the pose (which area should be working vs. relaxed), and understand overall muscle action to facilitate maximum efficiency, balancedenergy expenditure, increased participation duration, and enhanced sense of success.

# Cervical Vertebrae C1 - C7

5 .8 © Yoga Flow YOGA SpineCENTRAL AXIS OF THE BODY The Central Axis is usually composed of 33 Vertebrae with the coccyx is at the very tip- 7 Cervical Vertebrae (C1-C7)- 12 Thoracic Vertebrae (T1-T12)- 5 Lumbar (L1-L5)- 5 sacral vertebrae fused together (S1-S5)- 4 frequently fused Coccygeal Vertebrae, also known as the tailbone4 NATURAL CURVES Together these four curves provide balance and fluid movement. They act as shock absorbers;transferring and dispersing energy. Without the curves, our movements would be rigid and tight and we would not be able to twist, bend, and extend like we do in our yoga postures.1.Cervical Lordosis curve toward front body2.Thoracic Kyphosis curve toward back body3.Lumbar Lordosis curve toward front body4.Sacral Kyphosis curve toward back bodyWEAK LINKS We tend to move in these areas more because of the ease compared to the rest of the spine. Asa result, these areas become more mobile while other parts of the spine become tighter which can lead to injury. In yoga, we tend to:- Hinge at the lower neck C7-T1- Flare ribs T12-L1- Overarch through the lower back L5-S1SPINAL MOTION- Flexion Sagittal Plane, in a Forward Fold- Extension Sagittal Plane, in a Backbend- Lateral Flexion Frontal Plane Bends right and left, in a Side Bend- Rotation Transverse Plane rotates right and left, in a Twist- Axial Extension Elevate each vertebrae for maximum disc space, when you sit up as straight as you canLUMBAR PELVIC RHYTHM In Yoga, it is important to lead from the spine with the head in neutral alignment and to bend theknees as needed to maintain the natural Lumbar-Pelvic Rhythm. If hamstrings are tight, it willprevent this movement so a bend in the knees is necessary and will help support the proper form and alignment. The natural lumbar-pelvic rhythm is the simultaneous action of lumbar flexion and forward tilt of the pelvis in the sagittal planeduring trunk flexion.

ACTIVITY Bend forward. This is lumbar flexion followed by forward tilting of thepelvis at the hip joints (“duck butt” movement). Stand upright and bend forward again. Notice that theseare two separate movements of the body, low back forward folding and forward tilting of the pelvis. These motions must happen at the sametime in any forward fold to be safe on the low back, otherwise we unsafely put pressure on the lumbar spinaldiscs. If there is not enough length in the hamstrings, the knees mustbe bent to create slack for the pelvis to tilt forward. Initiate a return tothe standing posture by the reverse movement - the backwards tiltingof the pelvis at the hips followed by extension (opposite of a forwardfold) of the lumbar spine to return to neutral.

5.10 © Yoga Flow YOGA JointsJoints are locations on the body where two ormore bones make contact. Joints are constructed to allow movement and provide support. They are designed to be innately frictionless, absorb and control impact. Healthy joints house frictionless movement and mitigate external impact. In yoga, we focus on three types of joints:Hinge AThese function to allow mobility in forward andbackward movements or flexion and extension and to limit other mobility. ex. elbow, kneeBall and Socket BThe have the greatest mobility, allowing formovement in all 3 planes. Functional movementis for changing direction when walking, running or reaching. ex. hip, shoulderIntervertebral or Compressive JointLocated between the vertebrae of the spine, these allow limited mobility but provide great stability to protect the spinal cord.MOBILITY VS. STABILITY Being mindful about joint structure will support you in choosing and teaching yoga posesappropriately with the best intentions for yourstudents. The shoulder joint is commonly injured due to its great range of motion and lack ofstability. Proper alignment in shoulder activating yoga poses will greatly reduce the risk of injury.Inherent joint stability depends on the shape of the adjacent bones, density of connective tissue surrounding the joint capsule and strength ofmuscles that cross the joint. Joints with increased mobility due to adjacent bones tend to provideless innate structural stability. These joints require additional support from soft tissue structures(muscles, tendons, ligaments). Structuralimbalance or weakness of the supporting tissuessurrounding mobile joints introduces increased riskof injury (subluxation, impingement or dislocation).Conversely, joints with more innate structural stability due to adjacent bones tend towarddecreased mobility. Because of the enhanced stability, these joints do not rely on additional support from soft tissue structures.Example of Increased Mobility: Shoulder Joint Because of the shallow, cup-like shape of the outward-facing portion of the scapula (glenoidfossa) which does not completely house the head of the humerus (upper arm). The range of motionavailable is flexion, extension, abduction, horizontal ab/adduction, internal and external rotation,circumduction. In yoga, Eagle arms.Example of Increased Stability: Hip JointBecause of the shape and surface-to-surface contact area of the joint itself, created by theconnection between spherical head of the femurbone (the ball) within the acetabulum of the pelvis (the socket), and the vertical orientation of thejoint during weight bearing (standing), the hip joint is innately stable. While the structure of hip jointclassifies it similar to the shoulder joint as a “ball and socket” joint, the depth and orientation (down and out) of the acetabulum (socket) of the pelvis,as compared to the glenoid fossa (socket) of the scapula is what increases the stability of the hip joint versus that of the shoulder joint. Similar tothe shoulder joint, motions available at the hip joint are: flexion-extension, ab/adduction, and internal and external rotation, as well as circumduction. In yoga, supine figure-four.

BFascia, Ligaments and TendonsFASCIA- Continuous sheet of fibrous tissue locatedbeneath the skin that connects everything inthe body. Everything from bone to muscle fibers to nerve is wrapped in fascia. It is the “sausage casing” of the human body. ex. IT Band- Fascia tissue cannot be created or destroyed, but simply rearranged.- Fascia has a firm state when cool and a softstate when warm, thus it is important to warmup the body properly to access the muscles under the fascia in Yoga and create mobility.- If we allow any part of our bodies to remainimmobile, the fascia become less flexible and eventually restrict our movement. Posturalimbalances are largely due to imbalances in the fascia and tensegrity of the system.- Individuals vary in the density of their fascia tissue, impacting natural flexibility.LIGAMENTS C- Connects bone to bone at a joint- Thicker version of fascia- They stabilize the joint as well as control mobility- Vary in size and shape according to their function- Have limited to no elasticity. Over stretching or injury to ligaments compromises the stabilitypotential of a joint.TENDONS D- Connect muscle to bone (connects fascia of the muscles to fascia of the bones)- Thicker version of fascia

5.12 © Yoga Flow YOGA MusclesMuscles are elastic tissue fibers organized in bundled shapes throughout the body. Smallmovements don’t require every muscle fiber to be working, whereas bigger movements require many or all of the muscle fibers. The more you practice a pose, the more muscle fibers are engaged tostrengthen a muscle group.STRUCTURE and FUNCTION A- Muscle fibers are what cause a muscle to contract.- Muscle fibers contract in response to nervestimuli from the central nervous system sent from the brain.- This is a process involving the release of Calcium from the bones to the muscle.- The release of Calcium causes an effect which results in the shortening or contraction of theindividual muscle fiber which in turn affects the contraction of the entire muscle.- The force of the contraction transmits the force to the bones and moves the joint.Gastocnemius # Soleus # Tibialis Anterior # Quadriceps # Hamstrings # Gluteals # Adductors # Rectus Abdominis # Obliques # Transverse Abdominis # Erector Spinae # Latissimus Dorsi # Trapezius # Rhomboids # Serratus Anterior # Deltoids # Rotator Cuff # Pectoralis # Biceps # Triceps #

5.14 © Yoga Flow YOGA CONTRACTIONS When a muscle contracts, the brain sends a signal to the muscle that tells the fibers to lengthen,shorten or stay strong in a static position.1.Concentric - Muscle engagement during active muscle shortening.2.Eccentric - Muscle engagement during active muscle lengthening.3.Isometric - Muscle engagement under constant muscle length without movement.Example of Concentric to Eccentric AThe brain tells the rectus abdominals that it is time to perform a crunch. The rectus abdominal fibers shorten,causing the spine to flex and the chest to lift off the floor into a crunch. This is a concentric contraction for therectus abdominals. When lowering the chest back down to the starting position, the rectus abdominals contract eccentrically to lower the torso back to the ground with control.Example of Eccentric to Concentric BWhen lowering into a chaturanga, the triceps muscle works eccentrically (while lengthening) to control the elbowflexion (bending) during the lowering phase (high to low) of a chaturanga push-up. It must in order to fight to force of gravity. The triceps works concentrically to produce elbow extension to raise the body back up from low to High Plank position.MUSCLE BALANCE Muscle balance is the relationship between the Agonist and Antagonist. It is important to have muscle balance to prevent injury. If the Agonist is much stronger than the Antagonist, the Agonist can overpower and injure the Antagonist. Muscle imbalance is quite common. Know commonimbalances found in the average student and ways you can encourage through Yoga muscle balance.- Agonist - The primary muscle(s) responsible for the desired motion at a joint- Antagonist - Muscle(s) directly opposite (on the other side of the joint) as the agonist/primemover- Stabilizers - These muscles hold a joint in place while the exercise is being performed and the main muscles are supported. The stabilizersmuscles are not necessarily moving during an exercise, but provide stationary support.- Co-contraction - Agonist and Antagonist are simultaneously active. Muscle co-contraction increases joint stability and facilitates joint control.Every muscle has an opposing muscle group. For Example, Bicep to Tricep, Pectoralis toTrapezius, Quadriceps to Hamstrings, Rectus Abdominals to Erector Spinae

5.15 lower body muscles
There are several smaller muscles in your lower legs, all of which will be worked by focusing on the calves. There are two primarymuscle groups on the back of the lower legs (calf): gastrocnemius and soleus. When shortening in a contraction they point the toe(plantarflexion). On the front side of the lower leg you have the tibialis anterior muscle, which runs up the front of your shin and contracts to pull your foot and toes upward (dorsiflexion), theopposite movement of the calves.QUADRICEPS C- Group of four muscles that sit on the front of the thigh: vastus lateralis, medialis and intermedius, rectus femoris- They extend (straighten) the knee and flex (bend) the hip when they shorten in a contractionHAMSTRINGS D- Three muscles: semimembranosus, semitendinosus, biceps femoris- Originates at the sits bones and runs down to the lower side of the knee joint- Primarily functions when they shorten in a contraction are knee flexion (bringing the heel towards the glutes) and hip and thigh extension (moving the leg back)GLUTEALS E- Three muscles: gluteus minimus, medius, maximus- The ‘gluteus maximus’ is one of the strongest muscles in the body and covers a large part of the buttock- It connects the pelvis, sacrum, and tailbone to the thigh bone (femur) by soft tissues of the thigh and acts to extend, abduct and rotate the hip- Causes the leg to straighten at the hip when a person walks, runs, or climbs- Used to raise the body from a sitting positionADDUCTOR GROUP F- A group of five muscles: pectineus, longus, brevis, magnus, gracilis- Largest is magnus, which supports and can accentuate Mula Bandha (Pelvic Floor)- Contraction adducts the hips, pulls toward the midline

5.19 Reading Different BodiesAs human beings our bodies are similar in many ways. Similar bones, joints and soft tissuestructures carry us through the postures of life. There are also differences inherent in each body and understanding these differences is important to being a good yoga teacher.When learning to instruct a group of people in class, focus on the foundations of alignment tokeep your students safe. Look for LOOK FOR and choose cues based on what you see in yourstudent’s body. Since each body is different, poses will naturally look and feel different for everyone.It is important to understand some of the reasons why we see so much variety in postures fromstudent to student. Variances in the body’s genetic structure play a role including bone shape, bodyproportion, strength and length in soft tissueand muscle and fat tissue mass. Present or past injuries, lifestyle, emotional state and bodyawareness are also factors. Understanding some of these variances will give you confidence in your cues as well as precision in the instruction you are able to offer your students.What makes our pose look different? Bone shapeBody proportionStrength and length in soft tissue (tension vs. compression)Muscle and adipose tissueGeneticsPast injuriesLifestyleIntention and emotional stateInternal body awarenessSTRENGTH and FLEXIBILITY In our yoga students we have those naturally dominant in collagen fibers, those dominant in elastin fibers, those equally balanced in both,and every combination in between. As teachersit is our job to serve both the strong and flexible students and help them discover balance in allparts of themselves. By understanding geneticpre-dispositions we can treat each student as an individual and help them practice self-acceptance regardless of what their poses look like.Some people are naturally more flexible than others thanks to connective tissue genetics.Our muscles, fascia, ligaments and tendonscarry within them a genetic make-up that pre-determines the density of our soft tissue and the ease with which it naturally stretches. The genetic make-up is important to understand so we canteach our students to appreciate their individual bodies and not compare themselves to otheryogis in the class. Of course, lifestyle habits will have much to do with a student’s flexibility when they first step onto a yoga mat, but their natural genetic disposition will also always be present.Collagen and ElastinCollagen is made up of protein. It is firm, strong and resistant to stretching. A student with more collagen fibers in their connective tissue willnaturally be stronger and less flexible. Elastinis made of up fibers that are thin, stretchy and flexible like elastic. A person with more elastin in their connective tissue will be more naturally flexible.Ground SubstanceThe ground substance is the jelly like substancethat the collagen and elastin live in. When the body is cold, this ground substance firms and becomesless supple, restricting movement in the connective tissue. When you warm the body up, the ground© Yoga Flow YOGA

5.20 © Yoga Flow YOGA substance becomes more gel-like and allows the body to move with ease. It is important to always give our students a proper warm up so we arealways working with the supplest soft tissue.TENSION and COMPRESSION Tension is when soft tissue is not elastic enough to stretch to the full range of motion. Tensionis tightness in a muscle or connective tissuethat restricts movement. Overtime, with slow and steady stretching, you will see a change in elasticity and an increase in range of motion.Compression is when solid matter makes contact with another piece of solid matter and this contact stops the range of motion. Compression is when a bone hits another bone and cannot pass throughit, thus stopping the body at that position. Wealso experience compression of soft tissue, when muscle or fat gets squeezed between two bones. This can also restrict the movements of the body.When practicing yoga asana, a studentexperiences both tension and compression in their body. By exploring some of these common sites of compression we can learn much about reading and understanding our students’ bodies from head to toe. This knowledge will allow you to cue to what you see in the room and connect with studentsafter class by answering questions about their practice.Elbow CompressionEXTENSION: ulna to humerusPart of the ulna forms a hook shaped bone that fits into the notch of the humerus. The ulna hook pivots around the humerus until it bangs into the base of humerus socket. That is compression Wesee this in hypo/hyperextension of the elbow in any posePRONATION: radius to ulnaWhen rotating the palm from face up to facedown, the radius rotates around the ulna. The ulna doesn’t move, the radius rotates around the ulna to pronate the palm. Compression occurs when the radius hits the ulna, compressing the soft tissue in between. How far you can pronate is dictated by

5.21 the shape of your bones and the mass of the softtissue in between. We see this when you place your palms flat on the mat like in Downward FacingDog.Shoulder CompressionFLEXION: humerus to acromionThe humerus can reach above your head only as far back as the acromion process, where yourcollar bone attached to the top of your shoulder blade. When the humerus hits the boney place where the collar bone and shoulder blade meet, it experiences compression. The only way toexperience more shoulder flexion is to abduct the arms and go around the acromion process, asseen when widening the arms more than shoulder distance. We see this in Tadasana.Spinal CompressionLATERAL FLEXION: ribcage on the iliac crest of the pelvisThe natural height of the lumbar spine willdetermine the amount of space between your bottom rib and the top of your pelvis. Whenside bending, a shorter lumbar spine will yield compression of the ribs to the pelvis, limiting further movement. If you are not experiencingcompression, where will you feel the stretch? How else will spine length affect our students’ poses?Spine length vs. femur length in twisting poses like in Prayer Twist.Hip CompressionIn the hips, compression is rarely strict bonedirectly on bone but often soft tissue compression.ROTATION: femur on hip socketMany of us are predisposed to be more naturalinternal rotators or external rotators based on the shape and position of our hip socket. When your femur bone makes contact with the edge of yourhip socket, that is compression. We see external rotation in Baddha Konasana and internal rotation in back leg of Warrior 1 or both legs in Fixed Firm Pose.FLEXION, ABDUCTION, ADDUCTION: femur on pelvis The femur bone compresses against the bones of the pelvis, often with soft tissue in between.Because the hip is a ball and socket joint, this can happen in more than one plane of motion. Wesee flexion in Forward Fold and Half-Pigeon. If you are not experiencing compression, where will you feel the stretch? We see abduction in Horse and Warrior two. If you are not experiencingcompression, where will you feel the stretch?We see adduction in Supine Twist. If you are not experiencing compression, where will you feel the stretch? How does the hip affect knee safety inthese poses?Ankle CompressionDORSIFLEXION: front ankle bones on front of tibiaWe see this in Downward Facing Dog. If you are not experiencing compression, where will you feel the stretch?PLANTARFLEXION: heel bone onto the back of tibia We see this in Child’s Pose and Upward Facing Dog.

5.22 © Yoga Flow YOGA Nervous SystemSENSORY DIVISION Sensory receptors are divided into three classes based either on their location in the body or the location of the stimuli to which they respond, exteroceptors, that take in external stimuli,interoceptors; that take in internal stimuli, and proprioceptors, that help us monitor where our body is in space.Proprioceptors are located in the musculoskeletal organs such as skeletal muscles, tendons, jointsand ligaments. Proprioceptors monitor the degree of stretch within each of these structures andsend input on the body movements to the CNS. Proprioception is the body’s awareness of where it is in space and the movement of its limbs. The nervous system is constantly communicatingan awareness of the length and tension of each muscle and the location of the limbs. This is whybalance poses are so challenging when the eyes are closed. When not relying on the eyes, the nervoussystem must locate the body’s center of gravity and figure out where it is in space.The body can create holding patterns to protect muscles from fatigue. Some muscles are stuckin shortened positions because of habitual,imbalanced postures. For example, some people’s shoulders are stuck up toward their ears without their knowledge. If you tried holding your shoulder up towards your ear all day, you would find thatit’s much harder to consciously engage a muscle. Some muscles disengage, making others engage in their place. These improper patterns can oftenbe reset with awareness and repetition of correct movements through yoga. Showing a muscle its full range of motion is enough to reset it to itsproper length.The nervous system is the master control and communication system of the body - everythought, action, instinct and emotion reflects its activity. The nervous system is made up of fiber bundles that weave throughout the body, muchlike fascia. The nervous systems cells communicate through rapid and specific electrical signalssent through these fibers, which produce almost immediate responses. By stretching and movingthe nerve fibers while allowing the body and mind to experience the full journey of a yoga class, we can help our students fight disease, stress andincrease overall feelings of well-being.FUNCTIONS- Uses millions of sensory receptors to monitor changes occurring both inside and outside of the body- Processes and interprets the sensory input to make decisions about what should be done at each moment- Dictates a response by activating the effector organs (muscles or glands)TYPES OF NERVE CELLS The Central Nervous System (CNS) is theintegrating and command center of the nervous system. Consisting of the brain and the spinal cord, the CNS receives and interprets incoming sensory signals and dictates motor responsesbased on past experiences, reflexes and current conditions.The Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) consists mainly of nerves extending out from the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. These communication channels link all regions of the body to the CNS.

5.23 MOTOR DIVISION The motor division of the nervous system reacts to the stimuli brought in from the sensory division. It is divided into two systems. The Somatic Nervous System oversees the parts of our bodies we canvoluntarily control. For example; if you’re sitting next to a fire and it feels too warm for comfort, you voluntarily activate your leg muscles to moveyour body further from the flames. The Autonomic Nervous System responds to stimuli withoutvoluntary or conscious effort, such as the release of stress hormones if you feel yourself overheating in an uncomfortable way.The autonomic nervous system has twobranches; sympathetic and parasympathetic. Thesympathetic nervous system up-regulates our body functions. These are the feelings of fight, flightand fright that occur when a stressful situation is sensed. Our sympathetic nervous system is often overworked in our yoga students due to stresses of daily life in the modern world.The parasympathetic nervous system down-regulates our body functions. This is the relaxation response that allows us to rest, restore and repair.The practice of yoga gives the para-sympathetic nervous system a chance to do its thing, topractice relaxation.ACTIVITY Explore your sensory receptors. Close your eyes and hold your arms out infront of you. Do you know where your hands are? Do you know where your feet are? Could you stand up without swaying? Could you stand on one leg? Why is this important?When teaching, ask your studentsto bring their shoulders all the way to their ears and hold, then slowly all the way down. Repeat severaltimes. By bringing a muscle to each end point, it is better able to find the proper resting length.

BreathANATOMY OF BREATH Diaphragm ADome shaped muscle that divides ribs fromabdomen horizontally through the center of the body. The diaphragm pulls down to create more space in the lung cavity during an inhalation.Intercostal MusclesThese are located in the thorax or ribcage. Pull the ribs further apart for more air during an inhalation and squeeze the ribs together to push air out onforced exhalation.Oblique MusclesContracts during forced exhalation (cough, sneeze, laugh).Serratus Posterior BHelps pull ribs out of the way to create more space during an inhalation.Scalenes and Sternocleidomastoid (SCM)Pull the top ribs out of the way for upper chest breathing.EXERCISE AND GUIDED BREATH Breath takes place in three parts of the body. Because of the size and volume capacity of our lungs, a full breath should involve movement inall three areas and all three dimensions (front to back, side to side, top to bottom).- Diaphragm, stomach, and lower back body (front to back)- Clavicle (up and down)- Chest and ribs (side to side and all directions)Inhalation- Diaphragm moves downward, increasing lung volume- Intercostals muscles move the ribs apart from each other- Scalene and SCM move the top ribsExhalation- Diaphragm relaxes and returns upward expelling air out- The elasticity of the lung tissue aids in expelling air- The ribs relax and reduce the volume, thus air is forced outForced Exhalation- The intercostals pull the ribs closer togetherforcing air out (cough and feel the muscles work)- The abdominals assist in forcing air out of the lungs

5.25 Verbal CueDesired AdjustmentYOGABREATHING- Different styles of yogic breathing have different intentions- Some yogic breath patterns help to increase lung capacity- Some yogic breath patterns form undulations in the chest and belly to massage the organs- Abdominal breath can focus on expanding/ softening the belly and abdominal floor,activating the parasympathetic nervous system to calm the mind and body- Chest breathing can open the heart, wake up the intercostals and neck muscles and help correctpoor postureWhat are some anatomical cues or “yoga vernacular” youhave heard instructors use during your yoga practice? What was the cue and what do you think was the desired anatomical response?

SankalpaWHY Having a sankalpagives you a clear reason to guide your efforts, actions and choices. With all the changes in the world, our families, our friends, our roles, our projects, a sankalpabecomes a constant and allows our most meaningful project to be ourselves.WHAT Sankalpais a yogic formula which combines your truth with your resolve.“Kalpa” means "vow," like a vow one would make with another at marriage or a vow one asks another for at the end of life. “San” refers to our connection with our truth. It is beyond a resolution by the nature of its inherent truth. Truth exists in the past, present, and future and transcends time. That’s why most sankalpasare written in the now (I am, or I exist) vs a resolution for the future (I will).There are 2 common types of sankalpas:Heartfelt desire:A simple statement of “I am _____” --you at your most inspiredSpecific intention:A simple statement of “I exist to ____” of your life’s mission.One can evolve into anotherand they can merge.Ultimately, it is a promise from you, to you, to be you.
246your truthDifferentiate unique powers -how are you different?
Resonate superpowers -what are your one-word superpowers?
Substantiate timeless truths -whattimeless truths describe you?
Illustrate your desire -what do you really, truly want?

Scholars suggest several personsmay have developed yoga under the pseudonym Patanjali. In any case, Patanjali’s Yoga Sutrasare a precise set of doctrines and principles that create the foundation for living a Yogic life. They are intended to purify and create alignment inthe mind and spirit. They were compiled sometime between 200 BCE and 200 CE. Sutra translatesas unbroken thread of consciousness that draws together the beads of thought and all humanexperiences.The Yoga Sutras is 196 short verses or shlokas, broken down into 4 parts or pada. It is written in order (“nyasa”) to allow for easier memorization and passing down. Each thread is a pearl of wisdom upon which a teacher expands and adds their own meaning and experience. The four padas: 1 samadhi-padabliss/ecstasy- defines Yoga and obstacles that get in the way of balance and steadiness2 sadhana-padathe practice- tools and practice that support goal of Yoga- includes Kleshas/Koshas and 8-Fold Path3vibhuti-padathe powers- powers we gainwhen understand true self- includes inner limbs (6, 7, and 8)4 kaivalya-padaliberation

© Yoga Flow YOGA 6.4 THE THREADS OF UNION TRANSLATIO Nby BonGiovanniBefore beginning any spiritual text it is customary to clear the mind of all distracting thoughts, tocalm the breath and to purify the heart.Part One on Contemplations1.Now, instruction in Union.2.Union is restraining the thought-streams natural to the mind.3.Then the seer dwells in his own nature.4.Otherwise he is of the same form as the thought-streams.5.The thought-streams are five-fold, painful and not painful.6.Right knowledge, wrong knowledge, fancy, sleep and memory.7.Right knowledge is inference, tradition and genuine cognition.8.Wrong knowledge is false, illusory, erroneous beliefs or notions.9.Fancy is following after word-knowledge empty of substance.10.Deep sleep is the modification of the mind which has for its substratum nothingness.11.Memory is not allowing mental impressions to escape.12.These thought-streams are controlled by practice and non-attachment.13.Practice is the effort to secure steadiness.14.This practice becomes well-grounded when continued with reverent devotion and withoutinterruption over a long period of time.15.Desirelessness towards the seen and the unseen gives the consciousness of mastery.16.This is signified by an indifference to the three attributes, due to knowledge of the Indweller.17.Cognitive meditation is accompanied byreasoning, discrimination, bliss and the sense of ‘I am.’18.There is another meditation which is attained by the practice of alert mental suspension untilonly subtle impressions remain.19.For those beings who are formless and for those beings who are merged in unitive consciousness, the world is the cause.20.For others, clarity is preceded by faith,energy, memory and equal minded contemplation.21.Equal minded contemplation is nearest to those whose desire is most ardent.22.There is further distinction on account of the6.5 © Yoga Flow YOGA

6. 5mild, moderate or intense means employed.23.Or by surrender to God.24.God is a particular yet universal indweller,untouched by afflictions, actions, impressions and their results.25.In God, the seed of omniscience is unsurpassed.26.Not being conditioned by time, God is the teacher of even the ancients.27.God’s voice is Om.28.The repetition of Om should be made with an understanding of its meaning.29.From that is gained introspection and also the disappearance of obstacles.30.Disease, inertia, doubt, lack of enthusiasm, laziness, sensuality, mind-wandering, missing the point, instability- these distractions of the mind are the obstacles.31.Pain, despair, nervousness, and disordered inspiration and expiration are co-existent with these obstacles.32.For the prevention of the obstacles, one truth should be practiced constantly.33.By cultivating friendliness towards happiness and compassion towards misery, gladness towards virtue and indifference towards vice, the mindbecomes pure.34.Optionally, mental equanimity may be gained by the even expulsion and retention of energy.35.Or activity of the higher senses causes mental steadiness.36.Or the state of sorrowless Light.37.Or the mind taking as an object ofconcentration those who are freed of compulsion.38.Or depending on the knowledge of dreams and sleep.39.Or by meditation as desired.40.The mastery of one in Union extends from the finest atomic particle to the greatest infinity.41.When the agitations of the mind are under control, the mind becomes like a transparentcrystal and has the power of becoming whatever form is presented. Knower, act of knowing, or what is known.42.The argumentative condition is the confused mixing of the word, its right meaning, andknowledge.43.When the memory is purified and the mindshines forth as the object alone, it is called non- argumentative.44.In this way the meditative and the ultra-meditative having the subtle for their objects are also described.45.The province of the subtle terminates withpure matter that has no pattern or distinguishing mark.46.These constitute seeded contemplations.47.On attaining the purity of the ultra-meditative state there is the pure flow of spiritual consciousness.48.Therein is the faculty of supreme wisdom.49.The wisdom obtained in the higher states of consciousness is different from that obtained byinference and testimony as it refers to particulars.50.The habitual pattern of thought stands in the way of other impressions.51.With the suppression of even that through the suspension of all OPTIONS of the mind, contemplation without seed is attained.Part Two on Spiritual Disciplines1.Austerity, the study of sacred texts, andthe dedication of action to God constitute the discipline of Mystic Union.2.This discipline is practiced for the purpose of acquiring fixity of mind on the Lord, free from allimpurities and agitations, or on One’s Own Reality, and for attenuating the afflictions.3.The five afflictions are ignorance, egoism,attachment, aversion, and the desire to cling to life.4.Ignorance is the breeding place for all theothers whether they are dormant or attenuated, partially overcome or fully operative.5.Ignorance is taking the non-eternal for the eternal, the impure for the pure, evil for good and non-self as self.6.Egoism is the identification of the power that knows with the instruments of knowing.7.Attachment is that magnetic pattern which clusters in pleasure and pulls one towards such experience.8.Aversion is the magnetic pattern which clusters6. 6© Yoga Flow YOGA

It is of the nature of cognition, activity and rest, and is for thepurpose of experience and realization.19.The stages of the attributes effectingthe experienced world are the specialized and the unspecialized, the differentiated and the undifferentiated.20.The indweller is pure consciousness only,which though pure, sees through the mind and is identified by ego as being only the mind.21.The very existence of the seen is for the sake of the seer.22.Although Creation is discerned as not real for the one who has achieved the goal, it is yet real in that Creation remains the common experience to others.23.The association of the seer with Creation is for the distinct recognition of the objectiveworld, as well as for the recognition of the distinct nature of the seer.24.The cause of the association is ignorance.25.Liberation of the seer is the result of thedisassociation of the seer and the seen, with the disappearance of ignorance.26.The continuous practice of discrimination isthe means of attaining liberation.27.Steady wisdom manifests in seven stages.28.On the destruction of impurity by thesustained practice of the limbs of Union, the light of knowledge reveals the faculty of discrimination.29.The eight limbs of Union are self-restraintin actions, fixed observance, posture, regulation of energy, mind-control in sense engagements, concentration, meditation, and realization.30.Self-restraint in actions includes abstention from violence, from falsehoods, from stealing, from sexual engagements, and from acceptance of gifts.31.These five willing abstentions are not limited by rank, place, time or circumstance and constitute the Great Vow.32.The fixed observances are cleanliness,contentment, austerity, study and persevering devotion to God.33.When improper thoughts disturb the mind, there should be constant pondering over theopposites.34.Improper thoughts and emotions such as those of violence- whether done, caused to bedone, or even approved of - indeed, any thought originating in desire, anger or delusion, whether mild medium or intense - do all result in endless pain and misery. Overcome such distractions by pondering on the opposites.35.When one is confirmed in non-violence, hostility ceases in his presence.36.When one is firmly established in speaking truth, the fruits of action become subservient to him.37.All jewels approach him who is confirmed in honesty.38.When one is confirmed in celibacy, spiritual vigor is gained.39.When one is confirmed in non-possessiveness, the knowledge of the why and how of existence is attained.40.From purity follows a withdrawal from enchantment over one’s own body as well asa cessation of desire for physical contact with others.41.As a result of contentment there is purity of mind, one-pointedness, control of the senses, and fitness for the vision of the self.42.Supreme happiness is gained via contentment.6. 7© Yoga Flow YOGA

6. 743.Through sanctification and the removal ofimpurities, there arise special powers in the body and senses.44.By study comes communion with the Lord in the Form most admired.45.Realization is experienced by making the Lord the motive of all actions.46.The posture should be steady and comfortable.47.In effortless relaxation, dwell mentally on the Endless with utter attention.48.From that there is no disturbance from the dualities.49.When that exists, control of incoming and outgoing energies is next.50.It may be external, internal, or midway,regulated by time, place, or number, and of brief or long.51.Energy-control which goes beyond the sphere of external and internal is the fourth level - thevital.52.In this way, that which covers the light is destroyed.53.Thus the mind becomes fit for concentration.54.When the mind maintains awareness, yet does not mingle with the senses, nor the senses withsense impressions, then self-awareness blossoms.55.In this way comes mastery over the senses.Part Three on Divine Powers1.One-pointedness is steadfastness of the mind.2.Unbroken continuation of that mental ability is meditation.3.That same meditation when there is onlyconsciousness of the object of meditation and not of the mind is realization.4.The three appearing together are self-control.5.By mastery comes wisdom.6.The application of mastery is by stages.7.The three are more efficacious than the restraints.8.Even that is external to the seedless realization.9.The significant aspect is the union of the mind with the moment of absorption, when the outgoingthought disappears and the absorptive experience appears.10.From sublimation of this union comes the peaceful flow of unbroken unitive cognition.11.The contemplative transformation of this is equal mindedness, witnessing the rise and destruction of distraction as well as one-pointedness itself.12.The mind becomes one-pointed when thesubsiding and rising thought-waves are exactly similar.13.In this state, it passes beyond the changes of inherent characteristics, properties and the conditional OPTIONS of object or sensory recognition.14.The object is that which preserves the latent characteristic, the rising characteristic or the yet- to-be-named characteristic that establishes one entity as specific.15.The succession of these changes in that entity is the cause of its modification.16.By self-control over these three-fold changes (of property, character and condition), knowledge of the past and the future arises.17.The sound of a word, the idea behind the word, and the object the idea signifies are often takenas being one thing and may be mistaken for one another. By self-control over their distinctions, understanding of all languages of all creatures arises.18.By self-control on the perception of mental impressions, knowledge of previous lives arises.19.By self-control on any mark of a body, the wisdom of the mind activating that body arises.20.By self-control on the form of a body, by suspending perceptibility and separatingeffulgence therefrom, there arises invisibility and inaudibility.21.Action is of two kinds, dormant and fruitful. By self-control on such action, one portends the time of death.22.By performing self-control on friendliness, the strength to grant joy arises.23.By self-control over any kind of strength, such as that of the elephant, that very strength arises.24.By self-control on the primal activator comes knowledge of the hidden, the subtle, and thedistant.6.8© Yoga Flow YOGA

Self-control brings trueknowledge of the indweller by itself.35.This spontaneous enlightenment results inintuitional perception of hearing, touching, seeing and smelling.36.To the outward turned mind, the sensory organs are perfections, but are obstacles to realization.37.When the bonds of the mind caused by action have been loosened, one may enter the body ofanother by knowledge of how the nerve-currents function.38.By self-control of the nerve-currents utilizing the life-breath, one may levitate, walk on water,swamps, thorns, or the like.39.By self-control over the maintenance of breath, one may radiate light.40.By self-control on the relation of the ear to the ether one gains distant hearing.41.By self-control over the relation of the body to the ether, and maintaining at the same time thethought of the lightness of cotton, one is able to pass through space.42.By self-control on the mind when it isseparated from the body - the state known as the Great Transcorporeal - all coverings are removed from the Light.43.Mastery over the elements arises when their gross and subtle forms, as well as their essential characteristics, and the inherent attributes and experiences they produce, is examined in self-control.44.Thereby one may become as tiny as an atom as well as having many other abilities, such asperfection of the body, and non-resistance to duty.45.Perfection of the body consists in beauty, grace, strength and adamantine hardness.46.By self-control on the changes that the sense- organs endure when contacting objects, and on the power of the sense of identity, and of the influence of the attributes, and the experience all theseproduce - one masters the senses.47.From that come swiftness of mind,independence of perception, and mastery over primordial matter.48.To one who recognizes the distinctive relation between vitality and indweller comes omnipotence and omniscience.49.Even for the destruction of the seed ofbondage by desirelessness there comes absolute independence.50.When invited by invisible beings one shouldbe neither flattered nor satisfied, for there is yet a possibility of ignorance rising up.51.By self-control over single moments and their succession there is wisdom born of discrimination.52.From that there is recognition of two similars when that difference cannot be distinguished byclass, characteristic or position.53.Intuition, which is the entire discriminativeknowledge, relates to all objects at all times, and is without succession.54.Liberation is attained when there is equal purity between vitality and the indweller.Part Four on Realizations1.Psychic powers arise by birth, drugs,incantations, purificatory acts or concentrated insight.2.Transformation into another state is by the directed flow of creative nature.3.Creative nature is not moved into action by any6. 9© Yoga Flow YOGA

6. 9incidental cause, but by the removal of obstacles, as in the case of a farmer clearing his field ofstones for irrigation.4.Created minds arise from egoism alone.5.There being difference of interest, one mind is the director of many minds.6.Of these, the mind born of concentrated insight is free from the impressions.7.The impressions of unitive cognition are neither good nor bad. In the case of the others, there arethree kinds of impressions.8.From them proceed the development of the tendencies which bring about the fruition ofactions.9.Because of the magnetic qualities of habitual mental patterns and memory, a relationship ofcause and effect clings even though there may be a change of embodiment by class, space and time.10.The desire to live is eternal, and the thought- clusters prompting a sense of identity arebeginningless.11.Being held together by cause and effect,substratum and object - the tendencies themselves disappear on the dissolution of these bases.12.The past and the future exist in the object itself as form and expression, there beingdifference in the conditions of the properties.13.Whether manifested or unmanifested they are of the nature of the attributes.14.Things assume reality because of the unity maintained within that modification.15.Even though the external object is the same, there is a difference of cognition in regard to the object because of the difference in mentality.16.And if an object known only to a single mind were not cognized by that mind, would it then exist?17.An object is known or not known by the mind, depending on whether or not the mind is colored by the object.18.The mutations of awareness are always known on account of the changelessness of its Lord, theindweller.19.Nor is the mind self-luminous, as it can be known.20.It is not possible for the mind to be both the perceived and the perceiver simultaneously.21.In the case of cognition of one mind byanother, we would have to assume cognition of cognition, and there would be confusion of memories.22.Consciousness appears to the mind itself as intellect when in that form in which it does notpass from place to place.23.The mind is said to perceive when it reflectsboth the indweller (the knower) and the objects of perception (the known).24.Though variegated by innumerable tendencies, the mind acts not for itself but for another, for the mind is of compound substance.25.For one who sees the distinction, there is no further confusing of the mind with the self.26.Then the awareness begins to discriminate, and gravitates towards liberation.27.Distractions arise from habitual thought patterns when practice is intermittent.28.The removal of the habitual thought patterns is similar to that of the afflictions alreadydescribed.29.To one who remains undistracted in even the highest intellection there comes the equal-minded realization known as The Cloud of Virtue. This is a result of discriminative discernment.30.From this there follows freedom from cause and effect and afflictions.31.The infinity of knowledge available to such a mind freed of all obscuration and property makes the universe of sensory perception seem small.32.Then the sequence of change in the threeattributes comes to an end, for they have fulfilled their function.33.The sequence of mutation occurs in everysecond, yet is comprehensible only at the end of a series.34.When the attributes cease mutativeassociation with awareness, they resolve intodormancy in Nature, and the indweller shines forth as pure consciousness. This is absolute freedom.

6 .11 © Yoga Flow YOGA The eight limbed yogic path is a step-by-step path toward the realization of yoga, or union, with the universal self. The eight limbs progress from themost external and gross practices, to the most internal and subtle practices.YAMA Patanjali’s Yoga Sutra lists five yamas, or moral restraints, which apply specifically to how youbehave outwardly toward other beings.- Ahimsa Non-Violence, Freedom from Harming- Satya Truthfulness- Asteya Non-Stealing, Freedom from Stealing- Brahmacharya Moderation- Aparigraha Non-Hoarding, Freedom from GraspingNIYAMA Patanjali’s Yoga Sutra lists five niyamas, orobservances, which apply specifically to how you conduct yourself on a more personal level.- Saucha Cleanliness- Santosha Contentment- Tapas Self Discipline- Svadhyaya Self Study- Isvara-pranidhana SurrenderASANA Originally asana referred to a yogi’s meditation seat; the word literally translated means “seat.”It also referred to one’s perspective based on the seat one was in. The view or point of referencechanges based on where or how one sits. This expanded the view of the yogi’s mind. As the practice of yoga has evolved, asana has cometo refer to the practice of all the physical yoga postures. The third limb is about gaining control over our physical bodies. Although the YogaSutra doesn’t say much about the physical asana practice, it does say “Sthira Sukham Asanam,”which means, “steady comfortable seat.” As asana is practiced and refined, challenging poses become more accessible and the practitioner is able to findThe 8 Limb Yogic Pathmore comfort in each pose. Eventually this skill can be taken “off the mat” as well, so that we are able to tread through life with more steadiness andease.PRANAYAMA The fourth limb, pranayama, refers to one’sown vital energy and life force. It is made up of two Sanskrit words: “prana” which means “lifeforce” or “vital energy” and “yama” which means “expansion” or “extension.” Our breath is ourmost tangible doorway into working with our own energy. For example, if you hold your breath for60 seconds, you may feel agitated or hot. If you were to slow down your exhales so that they were twice as long as your inhales, there would be anoticeable energetic shift. You would feel calmer and a racing mind may begin to slow down. Byworking with our breath, we learn how to manage our energy more skillfully.PRATYAHARA The fifth limb, pratyahara, means “withdrawal from the senses.” It bridges the gap from theexternal to the internal. In practicing pratyahara, one stops reaching out through the senses toward external stimuli. Energy and attention is directedinward toward the heart and mind, and the yogi is able to transition more easily toward the finalthree limbs. If you want to know your highest self, you can’t only look outward. You must look inward as well, or you will be missing the whole picture.“If you don’t go within, you go without.” Neale Donald WalshDHARANA Dharana is the initial step of the seventh limb. We live in a busy world that is constantly pulling ourattention in many different directions. We have been conditioned to constantly be on the lookout for the next “shiny object.” Through the practiceof dharana, we train the mind to focus on a single point, or object, for a prolonged period of time.

6 .12 The cultivation of a single point of focus requires patience, persistence and compassion towardoneself.DHYANA Once the body and mind have been prepared, weenter the seventh limb, dhyana, or meditation. In a true meditative state, the meditator is not aware of the actual act of meditating. They are onlyaware of the meditation object itself (examples:sound, mantra, image, intention, open awareness).In concentration practice, the practitioner isaware of the choice to focus, again and again, on the object. The ability to meditate first requiresthat one is able to concentrate. Meditation isusually described as a graceful practice, whereas concentration is described as an effortful practice. You can’t sit down and force yourself to meditate, but you can sit down and practice concentration, which will lead to longer and longer moments ofmeditation.SAMADHI Samadhi is the experience of enlightenment and non-duality; the experience of yoga. The wordsamadhi is made up of two Sanskrit words:“sama” which means “even” or “same” and “dhi” which means intellect. Samadhi refers to astate of complete evenness or equilibrium of the mind. It is what Patanjali describes in the Yoga Sutra as the cessation of the fluctuations ofthe mind. In samadhi, you no longer experience yourself as separate from everything else. There is no separation between the individual and the universal, oneness is realized.DharanaDhyana

6 .13 © Yoga Flow YOGA Yamas and NiyamasThe yamas and niyamas are the first two limbs of the eight-limbed path. They are the most concrete places to start, as they relate directly to howyou behave outwardly in the world and inwardly toward yourself. Incorporating these principalsinto your life can have a profound effect on your yoga practice and your peace of mind. Rather than trying to integrate them all at once, choose theone or two that resonate the most with you. Youmay find that by simply focusing on one, the others begin to fall into place.YAMAS Ahimsa Non-Violence, Freedom from HarmingMinimize the amount of harm you are causing to yourself and others in thought, word and deed, by becoming aware of the ways in which youmay bring suffering to others. This is the reason many yogis choose to practice a vegetarian diet. They believe that a plant-based diet creates the least amount of harm to the planet and to othersentient beings. Patanjali’s Yoga Sutra says “When you are established in ahimsa (non-harming),others will stop harming you.” You will be a space for gentle love and kindness.Satya TruthfulnessBefore you speak, ask yourself, “Is it true? Is it kind? Is it necessary?” Satya includes rightspeech and truthful communication, as well as skillful listening. When approached with a piece of gossip, be a discerning listener. When trulypracticing satya, one’s words and deeds are all in alignment with one another. Don’t think one thing and then say something else. Being truthful does not necessarily mean being as blunt as possible.Practice ahimsa as well, by telling the truth in the most skillful and constructive way possible. Gandhi often said he only practiced a balance of Ahimsaand Satya and that all other practices came out of those two.Asteya Non-Stealing, Freedom from Stealing Do not take what doesn’t belong to you. Do not take that which you haven’t earned. This applies to material things, as well as respecting others’ time, energy and hard work. If you’re alwaysshowing up for appointments 10 minutes late, you are stealing another’s valuable time. If you takecredit for someone else’s idea or hard work, that is not practicing asteya. Asteya also means balance between give and take. For some people, this may mean taking what is needed more often.Brahmacharya ModerationThe yogic path discourages overindulgence in many things, including food and sex. Obsession with these things may cause you to lose touchwith what is truly important in life. Brahmacharya is often described as moderation, specificallysensual. In classical yoga, brahmacharya refers specifically to sexual moderation. Never usesexuality to dominate or manipulate another being. Being faithful to your partner would be a form of brahmacharya. Don’t be too hard on yourself, everything in moderation, including moderation.Aparigraha Non-Hoarding, Freedom from Grasping Develop sensitivity to what you really need. Don’t take so much that others don’t have enough.Don’t be possessed by your possessions. As long as you are lusting after the next great thing, you will always have a sense of lack, which leads tosuffering and a feeling of separation. If there is something you want, take the necessary steps tomake it happen. Let go of your attachment to the outcome.

6 .14NIYAMAS Saucha CleanlinessCleanliness and purity can be practiced on anumber of different levels. A clean environment and living space: clear clutter, keep belongings organized and practice good feng shui. Aclean body: clean diet, good hygiene, well- kept appearance. A clean mind: consider theamount and the quality of the information you are inputting on a daily basis and be selective about the books and magazines you read, howmuch time you spend online and what television shows and movies you choose to consume. Clean company: spend time with people who uplift yourspirit and inspire you to be your best and set clear boundaries if you have toxic people in your life.Santosha ContentmentLook to yourself and your own innate goodness for happiness; that is the only place you will trulyfind it. Santosha also means being present. Rather than wishing for things to be different in your life, accept and appreciate the reality of what is. Doyou really need things to be different to be happy?Choose to be happy now. Cultivate santosha by making gratitude a daily practice. Notice themoments you are happy, even if they seem to be few and far between. Keep a gratitude journal. Count your blessings. Remind yourself often, “I have enough. I am enough.”Tapas Self DisciplineTransform yourself in the fire of positive change! The term tapas means “heat” and it refers to the discomfort that comes with breaking habitualthought and behavioral patterns to effect positive transformation in your life. If you have ever tried to break a bad habit, you will know that processis often accompanied by physical discomfort. You also recognize that the discomfort is a necessarystep toward the change you are seeking. Having tapas is rolling out your yoga mat and doing your practice, even when you’d rather stay home and watch TV and eat chips. It’s pulling an all-nighter to finish an important assignment to the best of your ability. Or holding an uncomfortable yogapose for those last three difficult breaths because you know it will make you stronger.Svadhyaya Self StudyBe aware of your actions as they are happening. Reflect on them later. Use your reflections to make positive changes to your actions in the future.Taking time to reflect quietly on your day through journaling or contemplation is a wonderful way to practice svadhyaya. Studying of yoga texts andscriptures is also said to be a form of svadhyaya, as you are studying the highest self.“The person practicing svadhyaya reads his own book of life, at the same time that he writes and revises it.”- B.K.S. Iyengar, Light on YogaIsvara-pranidhana SurrenderGive your life force energy to something higher than yourself. This is devotion and surrenderfor the small self to the higher self. We practiceisvara-pranidhana every time we dedicate or offer up our yoga practice to someone else. This has apowerful effect on your practice. It creates new sense of purpose when your practice is infusedwith intention and energy. Isvara-pranidhana also means letting go of doubt and making room for faith.

6 .17 © Yoga Flow YOGA Sanskrit is the classical language of India. Itsmodern form is Hindi and is one of the 22 official languages of India. Sanskrit is one of the earliest members of the Indo-European language family:Vedic Sanskrit, the pre-Classical form of thelanguage is a foundational language of English, French, Latin and Germanic languages.The adjective is Samskrta, coming from Samskar, sam meaning “together” and (s)kar – “do,make..” This is translated as put together, well or completely formed, refined or highly elaborated. There are 54 vowels and consonants, each with a masculine and feminine part, totaling 108.Example: deva = masculine, devi = feminineSAMSKRTA The cultured language, refined, consecrated andsanctified—has by definition always been a sacred and sophisticated language used for religious and learned discourse. It’s used for ceremonial rituals, hymns and mantras in India.PRAKRTA In contrast to Samskrta, this was the language spoken by the peopleDEVA-BHASA The “divine language” or the language of the demi gods.DEVANAGARI The almost exclusive use of script to publishSanskrit texts. The Om symbol is written in Deva script making it sacred text.PRONUNCIATION TIPS1.Emphasis goes on the first “A” in asana, at the end of most posture names.2.Double consonants create a “stop,” or make the consonant, pause, then let it explode.3.Aspirate an “H” when it is written.Sanskrit4.“T” and “D” are placed at the gums behind the upper teeth, vs English, where our consonants are pronounced on the front of our teeth.5.Since there is a dot over the final vowel in Samasthiti, you add a “hi” to the end so it ispronounced Samasthitihi. This takes the word from being a name of a posture to being aprayer, rather than just being “equal on all sides pose” as it directly translates, it’s the yogi’sprayer to keep us equal no matter what lifebrings, ups or downs, highs or lows, Downdogs or Crows, we are steady and joyful in all postures.WHY SANSKRIT IS USED IN CLASS It is a universal language for all yoga teachers that honors the teachers and the lineage thatcame before us. It honors the cultural legacies that produced the yoga practice, and something larger than the individual self. It is a consistent reference to the root of a technique. It is part of attempting to access higher levels of consciousness. Sanskritadds an energetic component to our students and ourselves. It can clear energy or balance the group, so everyone is on the same frequency.Each language has a vibratory structure intended for specific purposes. English has evolved into a conceptual language for communication whereas Sanskrit remains a language of vibrations andsound. Sanskrit creates entrainment, when twointeracting, oscillating bodies lock into phase, so that they vibrate in harmony due to the mutualinfluence they have on one another. In music, an in-tune instrument pulls another in tune. Yourfrequency will naturally ebb and flow and teachers and students will have a mutual influence on each other. Om brings balance to a class.Remember, sound is powerful. Take intoconsideration music, assisting and your body positioning in class.

6 .20© Yoga Flow YOGA PranayamaPranayama is the fourth limb of the AshtangaYoga path. It’s all about guiding life force through the conscious expansion and extension of breath.Prana means life force or vital energy and Yama translates to guide to expansion, extension or constraint.The breath is an essential and foundationalcomponent to all yoga postures and is a prioritythroughout class. The breath should be artfully and consistently cued. Oxygen is the most vital nutrient in our bodies and essential for proper and efficient functioning of the entire body - our brain, nerves, muscles and internal organs. We could live for days without food and water, however without oxygen a few short minutes is fatal. The benefits of mindful breathing include:- Balances energy in the body and mind- Increases body, mind connection- Supplies fresh oxygen to the whole body, cells and muscles- Removal of waste products and toxins from our body- Expands and stretches the rib cage, lungs, core and back- Utilizes full lung capacity, increasing oxygen exchange rates- Calms or energizes the nervous system- Can reverse stress responses; tension,headaches, anxiety, concentration challengesPranayama is often practiced seated andindependent from physical yoga postures. In Yoga Flow Yoga, we utilize a specific type ofpranayama to enliven and mindfully link postures in our practice.UJJAYI PRANAYAMA In Sanskrit the prefix “ud” means upward orexpanding, and conveys a sense of preeminence or power. The suffix “jaya” means conquest or success and from another point of view, restraint. Sotogether - create a conscious, audible, victorious breath.This breath is achieved by slightly constrictingthe vocal chords or the back of the throat as you would when fogging up a mirror, then inhalingand exhaling through the constriction of thethroat with a closed mouth. This creates a slow, rhythmic breath that expands lung capacitythrough increasing the vacuum effect in the lungs and sending air into the bottom lobes where the efficiency of oxygen transfer is the greatest. The audible sound, and the slow, dynamic oxygenation of the blood and body, creates the victoriouspractice.Ujjayi Pranayama breath slows and smoothsthe flow of breath, which in and of itself would be sufficient benefit, but there is so much more value to utilizing this breath. Performing thistype of pranayama during asana practice focuses awareness on long slow breathing by constantregulation of the constriction at the back to the throat and the sound that it creates. The breath is slightly warmed through the friction the aircreates flowing over a slightly narrowed back ofthe throat which helps the body to oxygenate the blood efficiently. The slowing of the breath allows the bottom lobes of the lungs to fill and increases the breath capacity while providing more energy for the practitioner.The inhale is usually harder to keep a narrowthroat, but regain that shape with each exhaleand you will soon be able to maintain this slow and smooth breath continuously, even as you practice! The challenge of keeping the throat position and

6 .21 the breath consistent helps to focus the mind and will help advance your mental practice as wellas the benefits to your energy during physicalpractice. As you teach, remember to release people back to natural breathing during Savasana to letthem completely relax and receive during that final posture.ACTIVITY To give Ujjayi breathing a try, inhale naturally through your nose and exhale through your mouth on a “HA”. Regulateyour breath for a 6 countnasal inhale and 6 count open mouth “HA” exhale for a fewbreaths. Once your breath is smooth, observe the slightnarrowing at the back of your throat, and keep that as youclose your mouth and inhaleand exhale through your nose.The sound you create willresemble the ocean or a “Darth Vader” breath. Now release the constricted throat and returnto your natural breath. Observe the change in your mind andbody from just a few minutes of this breath practice.
“For breath is life, and if you breathe well you will live long on earth.” Sanskrit Proverb© Yoga Flow YOGA

Intro to MeditationMeditation gives you what nothing else can give you: it introduces you to yourself. —Swami RamaThe self abides in its own nature. Patañjali, Yoga Sūtra1.3Meditation(stems frommeditatum, a Latin term meaning “to ponder”)is a training of your attention that awakens you beyond your conditioned mind and habitual thinking, andreveals the present moment. Meditation is a method of bringing yourselves to a place of restful attention in which you are more receptive and responsive to the world around you. Oldestdocumentedevidence of the practice of meditation are wall arts in the Indian subcontinent from approximately 5,000 to 3,500 BCE, showing people seated in meditative postures with half-closed eyesOldest written mention of meditation is from 1,500 BCE in the Vedas. The BrihadAranyaka Upanishad(f14th century BCE) lists nearly 70 generations of meditation gurus and students. In the Yoga Sūtras, the sage Patañjalidefines meditation in four Sanskrit words: yoga cittavrittinirodha“one-ness is the progressive quieting of the fluctuations of the mind”. (Yoga Sūtra1.2)There are many forms of meditation including Buddhist forms, and Hindu, and Kabalistic, and Jewish meditations, and Christian mystical, and Sufi, and Muslim, and Baha'i, and Zoroaster, and many more. 6th century BCE, Siddhartha Gautama (later to be known as the Buddha) left his royal life as a prince and set out to attain Enlightenment. Over the next several centuries, Buddhism spread all over Asia, and many different lineages were formed, such as the Buddhist styles of meditation (Vipassana), Loving-Kindness and Walking Meditation. Vipassana Insight meditation is at the heart of the teachings of awakening. Its purpose is to strengthen our capacity to experience “things as they are” directly, without the filter of thinking, judging or reacting. It consists of bringing a clear attention to whatever occurs in the present moment. There are many forms of Vipassana. Each style focuses on some aspect of the shifting experience of body and mind. - Goenka, focus primarily on bodily sensations. - MogokSayadaw, focus on mind directly. - Ajahn Naeb, focus on suffering. - MahasiSayadaw, note all experiences moment by moment.

ExperienceMetta MeditationSit comfortably and quietly and relax your body. Take some moments to feel your breath: breathe in, sense that you are receiving warmth and energy; breathe out, sense that you are letting go into openness. Silently or in a whisper, begin offering yourself prayers of lovingkindness. - May I be filled with lovingkindness; may I be held in lovingkindness. - May I feel safe and at ease. - May I feel protected from inner and outer harm. May I be happy. - May I accept myself just as I am. - May I touch deep, natural peace. - May I know the natural joy of being alive. May I find true refuge within my own being. - May my heart and mind awaken; may I be free. As you repeat each phrase, open to whatever images and feelings arise with the words. Approach the meditation as an exploration to notice what arises. Throughout the day: The more you remember to regard yourself with kindness, the more readily you will find a sense of connectedness and compassion. reflectionHow did you feel immediately after your meditation?What did you notice about your breath or body?

Take a few slow, deep breaths. And as you take a deep breath, bring in more oxygen enlivening the body. And as you exhale, have a sense of relaxing more deeply. You can notice your feet on the floor, notice the sensations of your feet touching the floor. The weight and pressure, vibration, heat. You can notice your legs against the chair, pressure, pulsing, heaviness, lightness. Notice your back against the chair. Bring your attention into your stomach area.

Experience
271Breath MeditationFind a sitting position that allows you to be stable and grounded yet open and at ease. Close your eyes and establish a simple sense of presence. Now, allowing your awareness to scan through your body and, wherever possible, softening and releasing obvious areas of physical tension. You might take a few very full breaths, and then allow your breath to be natural. Bringing your attention to where you most easily detect the breath, or perhaps where it’s most pleasurable … letting this place of experiencing the breath be your home base, an anchor to the present moment. Noticing your breath … right here. Each time you notice that your mind has wandered off is a moment of mindfulness. Gently bringing your attention back to the inflow and outflow of the breath, offering a relaxed, wakeful presence. Continuing with this relaxed and calming attention on the breath … Each time the attention wanders and you notice, gently bringing it back. Like training the puppy … no judgment. Simply a kindly return. Sit. Stay. This breath, just now. If it’s helpful, you can notice the beginning, and middle, and ending of the in-breath or rise … and the beginning, and middle, and end of the out-breath or the fall … Notice the space between breaths … rest yourself … relaxing with the breathing. Sensing the breath in the foreground, still aware of the field of sensations in the background. You are learning to be centered, balanced, and present for the breath and the living world of sensation … wisely aware of this changing life. Take one more breath. Be aware of your whole body as best you can. Take a breath. And then when you’re ready, you can open your eyes. reflectionHow did you feel immediately after your meditation?What did you notice about your breath or body?

To appreciate the significance of the chakras, consider the location, elementand seed sound or bijamantra and the lotus or mandalathat is used to depict each one. The seed sound is to be chanted while a practitioner meditates on each chakra’s symbolism, whether it be through an energetic quality, a deity associated, an element, bodily organ, color, or shape to create an experience or grow awareness of each of the chakras. Chakras are also represented by lotuses, symbolizing the unfolding of flower petals, which metaphorically describe the opening of a chakra.Lotus flowers are sacred in India. Growing from mud, they symbolize a path of development from a primitive being to fully blossoming.The base chakra rooted in the earth evolves into the 1,000-petal lotus flower at the crown of the head!Through meditation or chanting of the seed sound and focus on the chakras, a practitioner connects to the energy or element of the chakras and awakens a path for prana to flow. We can then better understand ourselves, the world around us and the world within us. The seed sounds and elements of earth, water, fire, wind, space/ether are not just “places in [the] body…everything has one of the [seed] sounds and elements within them…and the spinal chord[is] a musical instrument to play these notes from” (Raja Choudhury).Once awakened or open, it is said that one’s kundalini (the sleeping serpent at the base of the spine) prana is awakened and there is a pathway to knowing our essential Self or ānanda(AAH-nun-duh), bliss. ©COREPOWERYOGA

The Point of BalanceTHE HEART BRIDGE4th chakra -AnāhataChakra(ah-naa-huh-tuhchuck-ruh)The heart (the home of love and compassion) is the bridge between where experience shifts from me to we.The symbol of this chakra –two intersecting triangles, one pointing up and one pointing down --shows that it is the balance between the lower three chakras that represent our basic needs, and the higher chakras, that refer to the subtler energy chakras. THE UPPER THREE The upper three chakras correspond to thetranscendent nature of the human being:spoken truth or power of theword (throat chakra), intuition and wisdom (third eye chakra),and humilityand divinity (crown chakra
The lower triangle: Our need to feel seen, connected, have agency.The upper triangle:How we bring to life our higher level of consciousness and connection to our Self.The lower three: Our need to feel seen, connected, have agency, represented bythe first three chakras.The upper three:How we bring to life our higher level of consciousness and connection to our Self, represented by the upper three chakras

Nose and MouthBreathing through the nose requires more energy because air travels through narrower channel. Air through nose is more filtered –and warmer. The nose connects energetically to Ida (moon channel) / Pingala (sun channel), mouth to Sushumna (joyful mind channel)There’s a natural rhythm (laterality) by which every 90 minutes to 2 hours breath is more dominant in one side than the otherExperience –through your noseBreathe through nose for 2 minutes -12 breaths, 5 second inhale and exhaleDid you notice this requires more effort? Are you feeling warmer?Experience –through your mouthBreathe through mouth for 2 minutes -12 breaths, 5 second inhale and exhaleDid you notice this requires less effort?Are you feeling cooler?Determine your current laterality by bringing your hand under your nose and observing which side you're breathing from.- Right side:helpful for external focus/attention –Pingala channel- Left side:helpful for internal focus/awareness –Ida channel- Both sides:it’s in transition from one to the otherRESPIRATORY SYSTEM Process of moving air in and out of the body using all components of the respiratory pumpThe respiratory system takes oxygen in and pushes carbon dioxide out of the lungs. The lungs pull oxygen into the bloodstream and remove carbon dioxide from the bloodstreamAYURVEDIC APPLICATION Diaphragmatic Breath:- Create mindful eating- Improve digestion- Process undigested trauma- Improve menstrual cycles- Tridoshic(great for Vata)Ujjayi Breath:- Improves immunity- Boosts warmth and increase circulation- Stimulates vagusnerve and parasympathetic nervous system- Tridoshic(great for Vata and Kapha)Breath Retention or Box Breath:- Engages parasympathetic nervous system- Helps the body move into rest and restore- Good for digestion, blood pressure, and stress levels

Anatomy of the LungsLUNGS AS AN UPSIDE DOWNTREE- Trunk: trachea (windpipe) –this starts as one main channel and splits into two --it shares with digestive tract –the ability to swallow is the gentle lock of windpipe (throat lock) which keeps food out of lungs- Big branches: lobes, the right side has 3 lobes, the left side has only 2 (heart is located on left side)- Small branches: bronchi, main distributors of air to all areas of the lungs- Leaves: alveoli, these are tiny sacs (over 300 million) where exchange between oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs- The greatest amount of blood vessels is in the lowest part of the lungs:for maximum O2absorption and CO2 elimination, air needs to reach lowest parts of lungsRESPIRATORY DIAPHRAGM AExperience:Bring both your hands to your belly, right below your rib cage –inhale fully 5 seconds in 5 seconds out and feel the expansion of the belly when the diaphragm contracts with inhalesThe diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle, and it is the primary breathing muscle. During an INHAL Ethe diaphragmflattens out and presses down on the abdomen.It attaches from bottom of the sternum, base of rib cage and front of lower spine. All ofthe fibers run up and insert on the central tendonTRANSVERSE ABDOMINIS BExperience:bring both your hands to your belly, right below your rib cage –inhale fully 5 seconds in and 5 seconds out and feel the contraction of your transverse abs with your slow exhalesBreathing drill: isometric hold in cobra to experience your breathing musclesDeep layer of your coreMuscle fibers run horizontally and span from your lower ribs, lumbar fascia, front of your iliac crest, and inguinal ligament; connects to your lineaalba and your pubic boneWhile the diaphragm relaxing reduces tension allowing exhale –the transverse abs aid by pulling back in the abdominal organs which were pushed out by the diaphragm, helpful with a conscious or forced exhaleBEYOND THE LUNGS- Diffusion: the exchange of gases, occurs in the alveoli- Hemoglobin:oxygen attaches to red blood cells and is carried through the body- Cells:the oxygen from the blood combines with glucose to create cellular energy (ATP –adenosine triphosphate)- Mitochondria:the part of the cell where cellular respiration occursand energy is produced- VagusNerve C:The vagusnerve, also known as the vagal nerves, are the main nerves of your parasympathetic nervous system.

Pranayama 3 TYPES OF BREATHING Clavicular:an expansion of chest breathing (when belly breathing isn’t possible due to pregnancy or athletic core engagement) where clavicles lift to allow air to top of lungs.Thoracic:also known as chest breathing.The diaphragm is kept short and just the intercostal muscles work to expand and contract the diameter of the rib cage.This type of breathing is directly connected to the sympathetic nervous system and is effective for fight/flight.Diaphragmatic:also known as full or complete breathing.When the diaphragm is fully used,the bottom areas of the lungs, where most blood vessels are located, is used to create the most efficient exchange ofO2and CO2. For this contraction to fully happen, it’s necessary for the core muscles (primarily TA) to soften/contract long so that abdominal organs can move down and out.This type of breathing is directly connected to the parasympathetic nervous system.Breathing this way will take someone from fight/flight into rest/digest.NEW TO YOGA BREATHING Complete Breath –requires conscious use of diaphragm, internal and external intercostals, and transverse abs –an excellent place to begin as most people haven’t used their diaphragms to breathe since they were infants:- Inhale –fill your belly- Exhale –empty your bellyVictorious Breath (Ujjayi) –gently tone the muscles of your throat to create a softly audible, oceanic sound- Like root lock, the muscular toning is very gentle –like the way a baby grasps your finger- Sound is audible to you, perhaps the person next to you, and not the person across the room- Like breathing through the nose instead of mouth –victorious breath will further narrow the passageway of air to travel through which will require greater energy and will result in warmingADVANCED PRACTICE Box Breath (Sama VrittiPranayama) (pictured)Supports the parasympathetic nervous system ”rest and digest” system, especially when stressed and if the sympathetic nervous system, ”fight or flight” system, aims to create equal breath pattern of the inhales and exhales, with a pause in between. The breath retention practice can be considered an advanced practice as it can be stress or anxiety inducing and not recommended for new practitioners.ExperienceCreate a “box” with your breath With equal parts of inhale, hold,exhale, hold
CONTRAINDICATIONS Diaphragmatic Breath:- Recent surgery to torsoUjjayi Breath:- Sore throat- Upper respiratory infectionGeneral Precautions:- Any negative physical or emotional effects (pain, anxiety, agitation), discontinue practice immediately- Consult with qualified yoga instructor or your physicianBreath Retentionis an advanced practice as it can trigger stress or anxiety, and students should always practice caution with any form of breath manipulation as it can cause physical and emotional reactions.
INHALE –4 secondsHOLD –4 seconds
HOLD –4 secondsEXHALE –4 seconds

Cultural Appreciation and ContextDEFINING CULTURE AIn order to discuss the impact of cultural appreciation, we need a working definition of the word “Culture.” Culture can defined as a commonality based on different factors, like those pictured here. This is important as culture goes beyond what we may think on the surface. We may have several different cultures we navigate: a family culture, work culture, and a number of many other socially constructed cultures. Photos by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND
LODEN and ROSENER’S DIVERSITY WHEEL BMarilyn Loden and Dr. Judy Rosenercreated a framework for understanding characteristics that we use to create our cultural and social identity. The wheel pictured here is not a comprehensive list but is a place to start. What do you notice about the characteristics in the middle of the circle versus the outer? Defining CultureWhat does “culture” mean to you? What other cultures do you know about other than your own? From whose lens is that knowledge derived?
What symbols/examples of culture have you seen in media? How accurate are these representations?
ImpactWhat are some of the images/thoughts that come to mind when you think about: - Immigrant vs. Citizen- Criminal vs. Law Abiding- High school educated vs. Higher education- Low Income vs. Middle Class - Unhealthy Person vs. Healthy/Fit Person
What are the consequences of generalizing people based on their culture?
Who should determine the level of harm someone might experience when cultural appropriation occurs?A

Impact of Social HierarchyCultural and social hierarchy can lead to inequity between:marginalized groups (minority groups with less/without power) and privileged groups (dominant group with power)CULTURAL APPROPRIATION Cultural appropriation takes place when members of a majority group adopt cultural elements of a minority group in an exploitative, disrespectful, or stereotypical way. To fully understand its consequences, though, we need to make sure we have a working definition ofcultureitself…But there’s a difference betweenappreciatinga culture, which might include enjoying food from another country or learning a new language, andappropriatingit, which involves taking something “without authority or right,”*What is its harm?- The majority group benefits financially from the minority group’s culture it is appropriating- Simplifying and flattening the culture of the minority group and perpetuating stereotypes or caricature- Taking imagery or elements from the culture of a minority group without its original cultural purpose, and misusing or misrepresenting the cultureMOVING TOWARDS CULTURAL APPRECIATION Cultural appreciation, cultural competence and “cultural humility”* refers to the important work of being competent in the culture(s) that we are interacting with.Towards- Self –reflection: understanding your own experiences, family, ancestry, community and raise awareness- Listen to/read about/connect with those whose culture you are seeking to learn about- Honor and respect the culture that you are interacting withAway- Shame and judgment of self or others- Sports mascots using aspects of Native American culture- Continuing racial stereotypes- Lack of desire to reflect and seek educationpath forwardReflect and journal on the below to create a path towards cultural competency. What is something that you know now is an example of cultural appropriation and how can you shift this behavior/content towards cultural appreciation?
What is an example of cultural appropriation in yoga spaces? How can this shift into cultural appreciation and cultural competence?
When you witness an example of cultural appropriation, how would your respond/act if it happened to you? Or if you overheard about it?
What can you commit to learning while in teacher training? How can you expand your knowledge?

Implicit Bias”Our preferences -what and whom we favor or reject…can take different forms…psychologists routinely speak about two systems that characterize the mind: reflective and automatic.” (Banaji and Mahzarin, 2016, p 53*)“Everyday automatic preferences steer us towards less conscious decisions…our rationality is often no match for our automatic preference” (Banaji and Mahzarin, 2016, p 54*)AUTOMATIC PROGRAMMING Our preferences can stem from the mind being reflective -reflecting on our our values, such as life, education, religious beliefs, experience, and automatic, or implicit, non-conscious decision making. The automatic, part of our mind also informs our thoughts and feelings and actions, but in a way that we might not be able to explain or notice as clearly. The danger arises when the implicit or automatic part of our mind has a bigger, and potentially negative, impact. EXPLICIT BIAS Explicit bias is the traditional conceptualization of bias. With explicit bias, individuals are aware of their prejudices and attitudes toward certain groups. Positive or negative preferences for a particular group are conscious. Overt racism and racist comments are examples of explicit biases.*IMPLICIT OR UNCONSCIOUS BIAS Implicit bias involves all ofthe subconscious feelings, perceptions, attitudes, and stereotypes that have developed as a result ofprior influences and imprints. It is an automatic positive or negative preference for a group, based on one’s subconscious thoughts. However, implicit bias does not require animus; it only requires knowledge of a stereotype to produce discriminatory actions. Implicit bias can be just as problematic as explicit bias, because both may produce discriminatory behavior. With implicit bias, the individual may be unaware that biases, rather than the facts of a situation, are driving their decision-making.*Affinity Bias –tendency to warm up and give preference with people who we believe are like usConfirmation Bias –tendency to seek information that confirm our pre-existing beliefs and values304reflectionWhat is an experience (in your life or as a yoga student) you’ve had where you were felt seen, valued, safe? Conversely, what does it feel like when we are not seen, valued, safe?
How may this experience inspire the kind of space you want to create for your yoga students? And what qualities does a yoga teacher need to develop to provide that space?
What can be gained from a more inclusive yoga community?

Inclusive CommunicationInclusive Communication begins with our ability to listen with empathy.EMPATHY Showing an ability to understand and share the feelings of another.SYMPATHY The fact or power of sharing the feelings of another, especially in sorrow and trouble.Empathy + Sympathy= CompassionALIGNING INTENT and IMPACT Communication is often a delicate balance between intent and Impact.IntentThe words and actions youchoose have a specific and intended message. You may not see how your words or actions could be interpreted in a different way.Impact The message could beinterpreted in a different way by different people. The person may have been unintentionally offended or may have “taken it the wrong way”.ImpasseOption 1: Take responsibility for theimpact of your words (if you caused the harm), ask questions (if you were on the receiving end), work through it together, heal a possible division, and honor our collective humanity.Option 2: Say nothing, and lose respect for the person, and create a disconnection.ListeningTalking1.

Older Adults and Limited MobilityOLDER ADULTS With the increase in quality of life and life expectancy, people ages 55+ are staying healthier and fitter for longer.Common AilmentsHowever, as we age, we lose collagen and muscle mass which can make us more susceptible to injury. Also, people who move less, may experience a decrease in mobility and higher risk for certain health conditions.Therefore, older adults are at a higher risk of: - arthritis/bursitis- high blood pressure or poor circulation- increased body fat and decreased lean body muscle mass- osteoporosis- breathing difficulties- dizziness and vision problems- chronic pain- difficulty walking, standing, or balancing = greater risk of falling- anxiety-related symptoms related to aging, dying, getting hurt, or losing loved onesHow can we support?Include options focused on building/maintaining strength, balance and muscle toneEncourage mindfulness and acknowledge that advanced age does not mean less capability or desire to try on yoga!Many might now have more time for yoga practice! CAUSES OF LIMITED MOBILITY Recovering from injury or surgeryScar tissue from past injuryTraumatic brain injury/concussionChronic pain ex. Fibromyalgia, ArthritisCatch 22:movement can decrease pain in the long run, but movement can feel painfulThey may have anxiety related to the perception of the loss of quality of life.Encourage patience.Benefits from Practicing Yoga?Boosts blood circulation, respiratory system, the nervous systemStrengthens the heart and improves breath and stamina by increasing lung capacityIncreases joint mobility, muscular flexibility, and range of motionEndorphins, pain relief, sense of progress, and accomplishmentIncreased focusMeditation and pranayama can calm the mind helping with anxiety and depressionHow can we support?We can help by ASKING questions and listening to how we can use our knowledge of the body to support a life-long practice for these students.We can provide support before and after class with posture alternative ideas, as well as offering props!

Mythology of the PosesAs you are learning in your teacher training experience, the Sanskritlanguage helps us to identify our poses, also known as asanas, during a class experience. Some poses are named from nature, Mountain Pose is Tadasana,“Tad” refers to the word “mountain.” Others are names from body parts, Hands to Feet Pose (Gorilla Pose) is Padahastasana. “Pada” is feet and ”hasta” is hands. Others are named after deities, sages, warriors and other characters from Hindu mythology. Virabhadrasanais named after one of the great warrior Virabhadraand his story is quite the epic!It is important to note that in our experience of an asana practice, we may use English primary and Sanskrit secondarily and study mythology from the context of enjoyment and storytelling. However, as you were introduced in the history of yoga lecture, there is a historical and cultural significance to these stories and many of the characters are revered in a religious context to this day.The three main gods (the trimurti“three forms”) in Hindu mythology are Brahma “the creator”, Vishnu “the preserver” and Shiva “the destroyer.” They are also represented in other forms, such as Nataraja (Shiva) and Rama and Krishna (Vishnu) and have several important other figures connected to them like Sati, Parvati (Shiva’s female counterparts) or Garuda (Vishnu’s mount).The pages that follow share just a few of examples of mythology stories.

Ayurveda“One who is established in Self, who has balanced doshas (primary life force), balanced agni(fire of digestion), properly formed dhatus (tissues), proper elimination of malas (waste products), well-functioning bodily processes, and whose mind, soul, and senses are full of bliss is called a healthy person.”–SusrutaSamhita 15/44
Ayurveda is broken down into two concepts:Ayus= life (consisting of body, mind, senses and soul) or longevityVeda= Knowledge or wisdomàscience/truth of life or wisdom of longevity.It’s the sister science to yoga, as they are both concerned with the development of the soul and, to that end, the proper care of the body and the mind.Ayurveda is considered the original mind-body medicine. Ayurveda shares in its teachings (with yoga) how the body, mind, and spirit must exist in harmony to be healthy and happy. All three must be considered, managed, and nourished throughout lifeThe practices embraced by Ayurveda naturally overlap with yoga and the philosophical systems that guide them are the same. Yoga and Ayurveda are traced back to the 2nd Century BC. There are six perennial philosophies, the Sad Darshana, which are considered vedicschools of thought and serve as guides to understanding yoga and Ayurveda. The two main philosophies that we've adopted are Samkhya and Yoga.FINDING BALANCE Two laws to Ayurveda:1. Like increases like2. Opposites create balanceThree main texts- CakaraSamhita –the oldest Ayurveda text (OM and Agni)- SusrutaSamhita –compiled by the Sage Nagarjuna (surgery)- AstangaHrdayam–written by Vagbhata(more accessible self-care practices)foundationsFive elements PancaMahabhutasEther (akasa), air (vayu), fire (agni), water (apas, jala), earth (prthvi)Five sensesEars, skin, eyes, tongue, noseThree Doshas and ManifestationsVata, Pitta, Kapha- Prakriti: constitution, what you're born with, doesn't change- Virkriti:current state of doshas, or current expression, imbalance, can change throughout lifeIn the BhagavadGita Krishaexplains to Arjuna that we are a balance ofPuruṣa(essence, consciousness, divine body) and Prakriti (mind, matter, material body).Our material body is comprised of the three mahaguṇas(modes, states):- Sattva/Sattvic: Balanced,Harmonious- Rajas/Rajasic: Passion, Energy- Tamas/Tamasic: Stillness, InertiaSeven Dhatus -“building blocks” of the bodyBlood –rasaPlasma –raktaMuscle –mamsaFat –medaBone –asthiNervous Tissue –majjaReproductive tissue –shukra/artavaGunas(Qualities):These 20 qualities (gunas) can be used to classify food, lifestyle, and environments and forms the foundations of Ayurvedic treatments. They are categorized as 10 opposite pairs.
