VINYASA Vinyasa is a three-part Sanskrit word: ”vi” and “ny” and “asa” can be translated to mean “placement in a specific way” or to “place in a special way.” Vinyasa or vinyasa krama is intentional placement and sequencing of postures. One example is the placement of postures based on their similarities: Mountain Pose followed by Forward Fold both share leg orientation. Another is the placement of postures based on their breath: inhale postures followed by exhale postures.

THE HIPS What we call the hips includes multiple muscle groups that support your foundation, ability to stand upright, move, walk, run and do yoga asana (poses). Though the hips series only includes one posture, it is impactful. Muscles that vary in size and function such as the glutes, adductors, abductors, hip flexors, and piriformis to name a few, are affected when we do hip opening postures like half pigeon.

Seal your lips and inhale and exhale through your nose. Pretend you are blowing air through a straw as you create an audible breath. This is called your Ujjayi breath. Child’s Pose is a resting pose you can return to at any time. I’ll also be offering hands-on assists in addition to cuing and demonstrations.
