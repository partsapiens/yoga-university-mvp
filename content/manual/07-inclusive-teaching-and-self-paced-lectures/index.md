## 7.1 Chapter Overview & Objectives

This chapter translates self‑paced lectures into classroom‑ready moves. You'll apply inclusive, trauma‑aware, and culturally respectful teaching across populations and themes.

### By the end you can…

* State core trauma‑informed principles and embed them in cueing.
* Differentiate cultural appreciation from appropriation; teach with context.
* Adapt sequences for pregnancy, postpartum, older adults, and limited mobility.
* Use mythology, Ayurveda, and koshas as optional, respectful frameworks.

## 7.2 History Review — Advanced Timeline

A compact recap of key eras to support accurate theming. Dates are approximate and presented as one scholarly view among many.

* **Vedic (c. 1500–500 BCE)**: ritual, hymn, contemplative seeds.
* **Classical (c. 200 BCE–500 CE)**: codification; Yoga Sūtras.
* **Medieval (c. 500–1500)**: tantra/haṭha methods, subtle body maps.
* **Modern (19th–21st c.)**: global diffusion; posture‑forward schools.

## 7.3 Lecture Checkpoint

Use this space to summarize your key takeaways from the related video lecture and list one classroom experiment you'll try this week.

* 1–2 bullet insights.
* One cue you'll test, one measure of impact.

## 7.4 Trauma‑Informed Yoga

### Principles

A trauma-informed approach recognizes that many people have experienced trauma, and it seeks to create a space where they feel safe, seen, and empowered. It is not about being a therapist, but about being a compassionate and aware teacher.

*   **Safety**: Create a predictable and consistent environment. Start and end class on time. Let students know what to expect. Use clear and invitational language.
*   **Choice**: Emphasize that students are in control of their own practice. Offer options and variations for every pose. Frame modifications as intelligent choices, not as "lesser" versions of a pose.
*   **Agency**: Empower students to be the experts on their own bodies. Encourage interoception (the sensing of internal signals) and normalize resting or opting out of any part of the practice.
*   **Collaboration**: Create a sense of shared ownership of the space. Ask for feedback. Be open to learning from your students.

### Cueing Examples

*   Instead of: "*Don't* lock your knees." Try: "See if you can find a tiny, buoyant bend in your knees." (Invitational)
*   Instead of: "This pose is *good* for your hips." Try: "You might feel a sensation in your outer hips here." (Non-judgmental)
*   Instead of: "Hold the pose for 5 more breaths." Try: "Stay for up to 5 more breaths, or come out sooner if your body is telling you to." (Choice)

## 7.11 Cultural Appreciation & Context

### Teach with Context

* Credit sources and teachers; avoid essentializing living traditions.
* Explain when you adapt practices for your community — and why.
* Invite multiple interpretations; avoid one‑true‑way claims.

## 7.12 Impact of Social Hierarchy

* Consider affordability, scheduling, and space access in your community.
* Offer sliding scale or scholarships where feasible; partner with local orgs.
* Design trauma‑aware consent norms around touch and adjustments.

## 7.13 Implicit Bias

* Notice first impressions; slow down decisions that impact students.
* Audit your cue library for body/ability assumptions; diversify examples.
* Rotate demo bodies; avoid always choosing the same student profile.

## 7.14 Inclusive Communication

Inclusive communication is about using language that welcomes and respects all students, regardless of their body size, ability, age, race, gender, or experience level.

*   **Invitational Language**: Use words like "might," "could," "perhaps," "if it feels right for you." This turns your cues from commands into invitations.
*   **Functional Cues**: Cue the *function* of the pose, not the *form*. Instead of "Get your foot behind your head," try "The intention here is to externally rotate the hip. Where do you feel that happening?" This makes the pose accessible to every body.
*   **Body-Neutral Language**: Avoid language that praises certain bodies or abilities. Instead of "You have beautiful long hamstrings," try "I see you're finding a lot of space in that forward fold."
*   **Gender-Neutral Language**: Use gender-neutral terms like "everyone," "folks," "team," or "yogis" instead of "guys" or "ladies."

#### Case Study: Navigating a Student's Trauma Response

A teacher cues the class to come into Child's Pose. They notice one student, Maria, has curled into a tight ball, breathing rapidly.
*   **Teacher's Action:** The teacher approaches Maria quietly and speaks in a low, calm voice. "Maria, I notice you're in a different shape. Is there anything I can do to help you feel more comfortable?"
*   **The Response:** Maria whispers that she feels trapped.
*   **The Solution:** The teacher says, "Thank you for telling me. Would you like to try a version with your knees wide and your arms reaching forward? Or perhaps you'd prefer to lie on your back instead?" The teacher offers choices without making Maria feel singled out.
*   **The Outcome:** The teacher has created a safe space for Maria to honor her needs, building trust and demonstrating the principles of trauma-informed teaching in action.

#### Reflection Prompts

*   What are some of your own unconscious biases when it comes to yoga bodies or abilities? How can you work to unlearn them?
*   Review your own standard cueing for a pose like Warrior II. How could you make it more invitational and functional?

## 7.15 Pregnancy & Special Populations — Overview

**Important:** This material is educational, not medical advice. Always invite students to consult their healthcare providers and to self‑pace.

* Avoid overheating, breath‑holds, and supine compressive shapes as pregnancy progresses.
* Favor wide stances, props, and side‑lying options.
* Prioritize pelvic floor and breath coordination over intensity.

## 7.16 First & Second Trimester

* **1st Trimester:** fatigue/nausea common; keep effort moderate; avoid hot rooms.
* **2nd Trimester:** emphasize balance aids; widen stances; avoid deep closed twists.
* **Breath:** no retentions; longer, easy exhales; gentle diaphragmatic work.

## 7.17 Third & Fourth Trimester

* **3rd Trimester:** side‑lying savasana; elevated or side planks; focus on stability.
* **4th Trimester (postpartum):** gradual return; prioritize sleep, bonding, breath, pelvic floor reconnection.
* Screen for warning signs (pain, bleeding, dizziness) → stop and refer.

## 7.18 Older Adults & Limited Mobility

* Use chairs, walls, and props; teach transitions slowly with clear steps.
* Favor joint mobility, balance training, and breath over range "maxing."
* Offer wrist/shoulder alternatives for weight‑bearing shapes.

## 7.19 Mythology of the Poses

Myths offer metaphor, not dogma. Share selectively to illuminate values like courage, compassion, and discernment.

## 7.20 Asana Myths — Examples

* **Tāḍāsana (Mountain)**: steadiness and presence → slow build to balance work.
* **Vīrabhadrāsana (Warrior)**: courage with humility → power poses + soft gaze.
* **Naṭarājāsana (Dancer)**: dynamic balance → playful oscillation, micro‑movements.

## 7.21 Ayurveda — A Practical Primer

Use Ayurveda as an optional lens for rhythm and recovery, not as medical claims.

* Balance *doṣa* tendencies with opposite qualities: heavy ↔ light, fast ↔ slow, dry ↔ moist.
* Seasonal theming: cooling in summer, warming in winter, grounding in autumn.
* Daily rhythm: consistent sleep, meal timing, and gentle morning breathwork.

## 7.22 Koshas — The Vital Sheaths

Five interwoven "layers" of being. Offer as an optional map for sequencing from gross to subtle.

1. **Annamaya** (physical): movement, stability.
2. **Prāṇamaya** (energy/breath): pacing, pranayama.
3. **Manomaya** (mind): focus, intention, self‑talk.
4. **Vijñānamaya** (insight): discernment, choices.
5. **Ānandamaya** (bliss): rest, connection, ease.
