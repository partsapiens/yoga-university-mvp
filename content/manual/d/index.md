5.12 © Yoga Flow YOGA MusclesMuscles are elastic tissue fibers organized in bundled shapes throughout the body. Smallmovements don’t require every muscle fiber to be working, whereas bigger movements require many or all of the muscle fibers. The more you practice a pose, the more muscle fibers are engaged tostrengthen a muscle group.STRUCTURE and FUNCTION A-Muscle fibers are what cause a muscle to contract.-Muscle fibers contract in response to nervestimuli from the central nervous system sent from the brain.-This is a process involving the release of Calcium from the bones to the muscle.-The release of Calcium causes an effect which results in the shortening or contraction of theindividual muscle fiber which in turn affects the contraction of the entire muscle.-The force of the contraction transmits the force to the bones and moves the joint.Gastocnemius # Soleus # Tibialis Anterior # Quadriceps # Hamstrings # Gluteals # Adductors # Rectus Abdominis # Obliques # Transverse Abdominis # Erector Spinae # Latissimus Dorsi # Trapezius # Rhomboids # Serratus Anterior # Deltoids # Rotator Cuff # Pectoralis # Biceps # Triceps #

Eupper body musclesERECTOR SPINAE A-Runs parallel to the spine, one on each side like bowling bumpers to help keep the spine erect-Contracting these muscles straightens or extends the spine,while contracting only one side will produce a rotational effectLATISSIMUS DORSI B-Broad triangle covering most of the back from the neck to the pelvis-Extends the arms (from a flexed position) and internally rotates and adducts the armsTRAPEZIUS C-Broad triangular-shaped muscle covering the upper and middle back-Contraction of the upper fibers elevates the scapula-Contraction of the middle fibers adducts the scapula, assisting the rhomboids in opening the chestRHOMBOIDS D-Originate from the spine and attached on the scapula (shoulder blade)-Draws the shoulder blades towards the midline and opens the chestSERRATUS ANTERIOR E-Primary role is to keep the scapula flush to the thorax or ribcage-This muscle has multiple heads, resembling feathers that adhere to the top nine ribs-Contraction of this muscle draws the scapula forward and away from the midline (e.g. punching)-Relaxing the Serratus Anterior allows the scapula to draw back towards the midline, opening the chest-Weakness in this muscle group shows in the “winging” of the shoulder blades in Chaturanga
