# Journaling

is a great way to extend the classroom experience. Reflecting on your yoga practice will allow you to see how it relates to the content of your training.

Journaling is part of Svadhyaya (self-study) and is required to complete your certification.

You will journal about each class where you practice, each class you observe, each outside class and each large group lecture or classroom session. Keep a running class count and you have unlimited yoga during the program. We encourage you to start on these requirements as soon as you can.

### JOURNAL TIPS

- Reflect on your overall experience. How do you feel? What did you learn about your practice? What new things did you learn about guiding a class effectively?
- How did the instructor use energy, voice, their playlist or the environment (light, music, heat if applicable) to support their class?
- What cues were effective and why?
- What did the teacher speak to outside of the physical aspects of yoga (theme)?
- What is at least one learning you are taking away from this class experience?
- How did your teacher weave their theme into class?
- Did you receive any adjustments? What did they help you learn?
- Describe the Instructor's demonstrations. What was effective? Was anything less than effective or missed the mark according to your observation?

## Reading & Resources

Do the best you can to cover the material but be patient with yourself as these terms and concepts begin to soak in. Remember yoga is a lifelong practice.

Review the posture breakdowns for all postures. Pay special attention to the key points of alignment, OPTIONS and benefits of each posture.

Review your notes and handouts from each session including the Philosophy, Anatomy, Contraindications and Pregnancy and Business of Yoga lectures as well as the hands-on Assists sessions.

### Reflection Questions

1. Why are you attending this training?
2. What are three things you hope to achieve during this training?
3. What do you think will be the most challenging part of training?
4. How do you think this training will change your life?
5. What is yoga to you? Considering that yoga means "union" or "connection," how would you describe what we are connecting ourselves to?
