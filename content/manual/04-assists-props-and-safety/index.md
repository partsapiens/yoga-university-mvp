## 4.1 Principles of Assisting

Assisting is not about "fixing" a student's pose. It is a form of communication and support, offered with the utmost respect for the student's autonomy and inner experience. An effective assist helps a student feel a pose more deeply or find a more stable and sustainable alignment.

*   **Consent & choice**: This is the non-negotiable foundation. Consent must be enthusiastic and can be revoked at any time.
    *   **Class Example:** At the beginning of class, say: "I offer hands-on assists in this class. If you would prefer not to be touched today for any reason, simply give me a small shake of the head if I approach you. Your practice, your choice."
*   **See first, then say, then show**: Before you touch, use your words. A precise verbal cue is often more empowering than a physical adjustment. If words don't work, demonstrate on your own body. A physical assist is the last resort, not the first.
*   **Stability before depth**: Your assist should help the student find their own stability. For example, instead of pushing a student deeper into a twist, provide a grounding touch at their hip to help them twist from a more stable base.
*   **Neutral, supportive contact**: Your touch should be confident, firm, and supportive. Use the palms of your hands rather than your fingertips. An assist should feel like a supportive brace, not a push or a pull.
*   **Student‑directed depth**: Empower your students. Instead of "correcting" their pose, offer a cue that allows them to find the alignment themselves. For example, instead of pulling a student's shoulders back, you could whisper, "Can you broaden across your collarbones?"

#### Reflection Prompts

*   What is your personal comfort level with receiving hands-on assists? How does this inform your approach to assisting others?
*   Think of a time a teacher's verbal cue helped you more than a physical adjustment. What made it effective?

## 4.2 Sample Assists by Pose

### Child's Pose — Balasana (sacrum length)

* Teacher hands broad at sacrum; invite length back through hips.
* Verbal: "Press your hands down and draw your hips back."

### Standing Forward Fold — Uttanasana (hamstring space)

* One hand at sacrum for grounding, the other guides length through spine.
* Verbal: "Soften knees; hinge at hips; lengthen crown forward."

### Halfway Lift — Ardha Uttanasana (scapular set)

* Light touch to upper back: "Draw shoulder blades onto your back."
* Maintain neutral neck; avoid pressing on cervical spine.

### Warrior II — Virabhadrasana II (hip stability)

* Square shoulders over hips; cue knee to track 2nd/3rd toe.
* Verbal: "Reach evenly through both arms; soften front ribs."

### Side Plank — Vasisthasana (stacking)

* Guide rib cage up; stack shoulder over wrist, hips over heels.
* Offer block under bottom hand or lower knee variation.

## 4.17 Props — Types & Uses

Props are tools of self-discovery. They allow us to find a version of a pose that is both stable and easeful. They are not a sign of weakness, but of wisdom.

*   **Blocks**: The most versatile prop. Use them to bring the floor closer to you in poses like Triangle or Half Moon. Use them for support in restorative poses. Use them for engagement by squeezing a block between your thighs.
*   **Straps**: A strap is an extension of your arms. It allows you to connect your hands in poses where your shoulders are tight (e.g., Gomukhasana arms) or to connect your hands to your feet in forward folds, without compromising the length of your spine.
*   **Wall**: The wall is your most stable teacher. It provides unwavering support and clear feedback on your alignment in balancing poses and inversions.
*   **Bolsters/blankets**: These props are for comfort and support. A blanket under the knees can relieve low back strain. A bolster under the chest in Child's Pose can create a deeply restorative experience.

> Props make poses *truer*, not easier—prioritize alignment and nervous‑system safety.

#### Case Study: The Student Who Resists Props

A student named David, who is strong and athletic, never uses props. He strains to touch the floor in forward folds, rounding his back.
*   **Teacher's Approach:** The teacher doesn't single David out. Instead, they say to the whole class, "I invite everyone to take two blocks to the top of your mat. Let's see how using them in our next forward fold can help us find more length in our spines."
*   **The Cue:** As the class moves into the fold, the teacher says, "Place your hands on the blocks at any height. Now, press into the blocks to pull your heart forward and flatten your back."
*   **Result:** David reluctantly tries the blocks. He discovers that with his hands on the blocks, he can maintain a long spine and feel a deeper, more productive stretch in his hamstrings. The teacher has reframed props from a tool for "less flexible" people to a tool for a "deeper experience."

## 4.19 Safety & Contraindications

### What is a contraindication?

A contraindication is any condition that makes a particular pose or practice inadvisable. As teachers, we are not medical professionals, so we must empower students to be the experts on their own bodies.

*   **General Contraindications:** These include recent surgery, acute injury, high or low blood pressure, and vertigo.
*   **Pregnancy:** This requires specific modifications (see Chapter 7).
*   **Your Role:** Your job is not to diagnose, but to offer safe options and empower students to choose what is best for them. Always start a class by saying, "Please listen to your body and modify or rest as you need to. You are your own best teacher."

### Teacher Checklist

*   **Offer options for Vinyasa:** Always provide an option to skip Chaturanga and go directly to Downward-Facing Dog, or to take Cat-Cow instead.
*   **Protect the neck:** Cue students to keep the neck as a natural extension of the spine. Avoid cueing them to look up in poses like Triangle unless their neck is comfortable.
*   **Teach how to fall:** In balancing poses, teach students how to fall safely. "If you lose your balance in Tree Pose, just step your foot down."
*   **Normalize rest:** Encourage students to take Child's Pose whenever they need it. Frame it as a sign of listening to their body, not as a sign of weakness.
