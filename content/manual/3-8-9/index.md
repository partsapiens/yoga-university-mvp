3. 9 0© Yoga Flow YOGA Stretch your hip muscle while they are warm from the standing seriesOpen your hips before backbends
THE HIPSWhat we call the hips includes multiple muscle groups that support your foundation, ability to stand upright, move, walk, run and do yoga asana (poses). Though the hips series only includes one posture, it is impactful. Muscles that vary in size and function such as the glutes, adductors, abductors, hip flexors, and piriformis to name a few, are affected when we do hip opening postures like half pigeon.
