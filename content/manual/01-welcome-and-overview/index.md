## Welcome

Welcome to your YogaFlow Teacher Training journey—a powerful path of self-discovery, deep practice, and learning to guide others. This manual is your field guide. Carry it, annotate it, and let it inspire new insights. You are now part of the YogaFlow teaching community; we're excited to support your growth and transformation.

## Program Commitments

### Our Commitment

YogaFlow provides an exceptional, practical teacher-training program aligned with international yoga standards. With successful completion and optional registration with a recognized yoga alliance, you'll be qualified to share yoga professionally.

### Your Commitment

*   **Svādhyāya** (self-study): This is the core of your training. It means dedicating time to not just the physical practice, but also to observing your thoughts, reactions, and progress without judgment. It’s about becoming a student of yourself.
*   **Aparigraha** (non-attachment): You may enter this training with fixed ideas about what yoga is or what a teacher should be. Aparigraha invites you to hold those ideas lightly, making space for new perspectives and even a complete shift in your understanding.
*   **Tapas** (discipline): This is the focused energy that will carry you through challenges. It’s the commitment to show up for early morning lectures, to practice even when you don’t feel like it, and to engage with difficult concepts. It builds the heat of transformation.
*   **Satya** & **Ahimsā** (truth & non-harming): In a group setting, these principles are vital. Offer feedback to your peers from a place of compassion (Ahimsa) and honesty (Satya). Receive feedback with the same grace, knowing it is meant to help you grow.
*   **Brahmacharya**, **Śaucha** & **Santosha** (moderation, clarity, contentment): Teacher training can be intense. Practice wise use of your energy (Brahmacharya), maintain clarity in your space and mind (Śaucha), and find moments of gratitude and contentment (Santosha) amidst the hard work.

> You'll get out of this journey exactly what you put into it.

#### Case Study: The Journey of a New Trainee

Meet Alex. Alex started teacher training with a strong asana practice but was nervous about public speaking and philosophy.
*   **Weeks 1-3:** Alex focused on **Tapas**, diligently attending every session and taking copious notes. Journaling (a form of **Svādhyāya**) revealed a fear of "not knowing enough."
*   **Weeks 4-6:** During a practice teaching session, a peer gave Alex feedback that their cues were hard to follow (**Satya** delivered with **Ahimsa**). Instead of getting defensive, Alex practiced **Aparigraha**, letting go of the need to be perfect.
*   **Weeks 7-9:** Alex began finding joy in the philosophy lectures (**Santosha**) and learned to manage energy levels (**Brahmacharya**).
By the end of the program, Alex wasn't just a knowledgeable teacher, but a more self-aware and resilient individual. Your journey will be your own, with its own unique lessons.

## TT Intention & Methodology

The intention of YogaFlow Teacher Training is to strengthen your personal practice, equip you to teach confidently and safely, and inspire transformation in yourself and your students.

* Foundational sequencing (C1) in the first half of training.
* Advanced sequencing, theming, and customization in the second half.
* Lectures in anatomy, yoga philosophy, and inclusive teaching.
* Practice teaching and group discussions for real-world skills.

Whether or not you teach professionally, these skills influence how you think, connect, and navigate daily life.

## Setup for Success

* Embrace learning and participate actively.
* Practice more days than you don't.
* Learn and use names; speak kindly and only when necessary.
* Use inclusive language ("team," "everyone," "friends").
* Share when it adds value; keep a growth mindset.

## Journals & Quizzes

Journaling every practice and lecture is part of svādhyāya and supports certification. Reflect on how your body felt, what you learned about sequencing and cueing, effective demonstrations, adjustments, theming, and at least one takeaway from each class.

### Example Journal Entry

**Date:** 2023-10-26
**Practice/Lecture:** Vinyasa Flow with emphasis on Warrior II
**Body:** My hips felt tight today, especially on the right side in Warrior II. I noticed I was clenching my jaw.
**Sequencing/Cueing:** The cue "spin your back heel down as if stamping a seal" really helped me ground my back foot. I also noticed the teacher linked breath to every single movement, even small transitions.
**Takeaway:** I realized I hold tension in my jaw during difficult poses. My intention for tomorrow's practice is to consciously soften my face.

### Reflection Prompts

*   What was one moment in practice or lecture today where you felt fully present?
*   What is one belief you hold about yoga or teaching that you are willing to question during this training (Aparigraha)?
*   How did you practice self-care and moderation (Brahmacharya, Santosha) today, even in a small way?
