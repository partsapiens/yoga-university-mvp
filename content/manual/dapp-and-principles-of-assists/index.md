# DAPP and Principles of Assists

IntentionThe intention of an adjustment is to set the student up for success. Adjust or “assist” thestudent to foster proper and healthy alignment. All your intentions are transferred through your touch, the words you speak and your body language, so it should be pure and supportive.Breathe With ThemMatch your breath to the student’s breath. Also, breathe while you adjust, as it will help to protect you from injury.Ground DownBegin with the foundation and build upon that.Find your own grounded stance and work fromthat place. To provide a safe, confident assist, you must have a solid connection to the earth and your student.Know the AssistTeach and adjust only from your personalexperience. Know where you are going and how to get there. If you have not experienced aparticular adjustment, do not try it on a student. Always practice new adjustments on or with other instructors.DAPP This is a methodical way to approach poses and offer ways to customize four elements:1.Depth–the muscular effort of the pose, such as sitting back deeper in a pose2.Angle–a bone angle change, such as a soft bend in the knee 3.Prop –the use of a tool like a block, strap to enhance the pose or make it more accessible4.Pose –an alternative pose that has a similar intention but may look different or be more supportiveThere are multiple tools in your toolbox to support your students such as the four main types of assists and DAPP. Use all of these during your class to ensure your student feels successful. If offering touch, have a way to ask for consent, such as an assist token with a “yes/no” side.
THE APPROACH Be Present and ConfidentBe fully engaged in the posture with the student you are assisting. Keep your touch firm and grounded so that your student trusts that you are with them and so they will be safe in the assist. Assess and decide exactly how you will assist before you beginand approach confidently so thestudent trusts you.4. 3
