VINYASAVinyasa is a three-part Sanskrit word: ”vi” and “ny” and “asa” can be translated to mean “placement in a specific way” or to “place in a special way.” Vinyasa or vinyasa krama is intentional placement and sequencing of postures. One example is the placement of postures based on their similarities: Mountain Pose followed by Forward Fold both share leg orientation. Another is the placement of postures based on their breath: inhale postures followed by exhale postures.
