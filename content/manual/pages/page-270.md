ExperienceMetta MeditationSit comfortably and quietly and relax your body. Take some moments to feel your breath: breathe in, sense that you are receiving warmth and energy; breathe out, sense that you are letting go into openness. Silently or in a whisper, begin offering yourself prayers of lovingkindness. •May I be filled with lovingkindness; may I be held in lovingkindness. •May I feel safe and at ease. •May I feel protected from inner and outer harm. May I be happy. •May I accept myself just as I am. •May I touch deep, natural peace. •May I know the natural joy of being alive. May I find true refuge within my own being. •May my heart and mind awaken; may I be free. As you repeat each phrase, open to whatever images and feelings arise with the words. Approach the meditation as an exploration to notice what arises. Throughout the day: The more you remember to regard yourself with kindness, the more readily you will find a sense of connectedness and compassion. reflectionHow did you feel immediately after your meditation?What did you notice about your breath or body?
