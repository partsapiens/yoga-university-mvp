BFascia, Ligaments and TendonsFASCIA•Continuous sheet of fibrous tissue locatedbeneath the skin that connects everything inthe body. Everything from bone to muscle fibers to nerve is wrapped in fascia. It is the “sausage casing” of the human body. ex. IT Band•Fascia tissue cannot be created or destroyed, but simply rearranged.•Fascia has a firm state when cool and a softstate when warm, thus it is important to warmup the body properly to access the muscles under the fascia in Yoga and create mobility.•If we allow any part of our bodies to remainimmobile, the fascia become less flexible and eventually restrict our movement. Posturalimbalances are largely due to imbalances in the fascia and tensegrity of the system.•Individuals vary in the density of their fascia tissue, impacting natural flexibility.LIGAMENTS C•Connects bone to bone at a joint•Thicker version of fascia•They stabilize the joint as well as control mobility•Vary in size and shape according to their function•Have limited to no elasticity. Over stretching or injury to ligaments compromises the stabilitypotential of a joint.TENDONS D•Connect muscle to bone (connects fascia of the muscles to fascia of the bones)•Thicker version of fascia
