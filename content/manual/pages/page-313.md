Ayurveda“One who is established in Self, who has balanced doshas (primary life force), balanced agni(fire of digestion), properly formed dhatus (tissues), proper elimination of malas (waste products), well-functioning bodily processes, and whose mind, soul, and senses are full of bliss is called a healthy person.”–SusrutaSamhita 15/44
Ayurveda is broken down into two concepts:Ayus= life (consisting of body, mind, senses and soul) or longevityVeda= Knowledge or wisdomàscience/truth of life or wisdom of longevity.It’s the sister science to yoga, as they are both concerned with the development of the soul and, to that end, the proper care of the body and the mind.Ayurveda is considered the original mind-body medicine. Ayurveda shares in its teachings (with yoga) how the body, mind, and spirit must exist in harmony to be healthy and happy. All three must be considered, managed, and nourished throughout lifeThe practices embraced by Ayurveda naturally overlap with yoga and the philosophical systems that guide them are the same. Yoga and Ayurveda are traced back to the 2nd Century BC. There are six perennial philosophies, the Sad Darshana, which are considered vedicschools of thought and serve as guides to understanding yoga and Ayurveda. The two main philosophies that we've adopted are Samkhya and Yoga.FINDING BALANCETwo laws to Ayurveda:1. Like increases like2.
