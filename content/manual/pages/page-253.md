6. 743.Through sanctification and the removal ofimpurities, there arise special powers in the body and senses.44.By study comes communion with the Lord in the Form most admired.45.Realization is experienced by making the Lord the motive of all actions.46.The posture should be steady and comfortable.47.In effortless relaxation, dwell mentally on the Endless with utter attention.48.From that there is no disturbance from the dualities.49.When that exists, control of incoming and outgoing energies is next.50.It may be external, internal, or midway,regulated by time, place, or number, and of brief or long.51.Energy-control which goes beyond the sphere of external and internal is the fourth level - thevital.52.In this way, that which covers the light is destroyed.53.Thus the mind becomes fit for concentration.54.When the mind maintains awareness, yet does not mingle with the senses, nor the senses withsense impressions, then self-awareness blossoms.55.In this way comes mastery over the senses.Part Three on Divine Powers1.One-pointedness is steadfastness of the mind.2.Unbroken continuation of that mental ability is meditation.3.That same meditation when there is onlyconsciousness of the object of meditation and not of the mind is realization.4.The three appearing together are self-control.5.By mastery comes wisdom.6.The application of mastery is by stages.7.The three are more efficacious than the restraints.8.Even that is external to the seedless realization.9.The significant aspect is the union of the mind with the moment of absorption, when the outgoingthought disappears and the absorptive experience appears.10.From sublimation of this union comes the peaceful flow of unbroken unitive cognition.11.The contemplative transformation of this is equal mindedness, witnessing the rise and destruction of distraction as well as one-pointedness itself.12.The mind becomes one-pointed when thesubsiding and rising thought-waves are exactly similar.13.In this state, it passes beyond the changes of inherent characteristics, properties and the conditional OPTIONS of object or sensory recognition.14.The object is that which preserves the latent characteristic, the rising characteristic or the yet- to-be-named characteristic that establishes one entity as specific.15.The succession of these changes in that entity is the cause of its modification.16.By self-control over these three-fold changes (of property, character and condition), knowledge of the past and the future arises.17.The sound of a word, the idea behind the word, and the object the idea signifies are often takenas being one thing and may be mistaken for one another. By self-control over their distinctions, understanding of all languages of all creatures arises.18.By self-control on the perception of mental impressions, knowledge of previous lives arises.19.By self-control on any mark of a body, the wisdom of the mind activating that body arises.20.By self-control on the form of a body, by suspending perceptibility and separatingeffulgence therefrom, there arises invisibility and inaudibility.21.Action is of two kinds, dormant and fruitful. By self-control on such action, one portends the time of death.22.By performing self-control on friendliness, the strength to grant joy arises.23.By self-control over any kind of strength, such as that of the elephant, that very strength arises.24.By self-control on the primal activator comes knowledge of the hidden, the subtle, and thedistant.6.8© COREPOWER YOGA
