Anatomy of the LungsLUNGS AS AN UPSIDE DOWNTREE•Trunk: trachea (windpipe) –this starts as one main channel and splits into two --it shares with digestive tract –the ability to swallow is the gentle lock of windpipe (throat lock) which keeps food out of lungs•Big branches: lobes, the right side has 3 lobes, the left side has only 2 (heart is located on left side)•Small branches: bronchi, main distributors of air to all areas of the lungs•Leaves: alveoli, these are tiny sacs (over 300 million) where exchange between oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs•The greatest amount of blood vessels is in the lowest part of the lungs:for maximum O2absorption and CO2 elimination, air needs to reach lowest parts of lungsRESPIRATORY DIAPHRAGM AExperience:Bring both your hands to your belly, right below your rib cage –inhale fully 5 seconds in 5 seconds out and feel the expansion of the belly when the diaphragm contracts with inhalesThe diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle, and it is the primary breathing muscle. During an INHALEthe diaphragmflattens out and presses down on the abdomen.It attaches from bottom of the sternum, base of rib cage and front of lower spine. All ofthe fibers run up and insert on the central tendonTRANSVERSE ABDOMINIS BExperience:bring both your hands to your belly, right below your rib cage –inhale fully 5 seconds in and 5 seconds out and feel the contraction of your transverse abs with your slow exhalesBreathing drill: isometric hold in cobra to experience your breathing musclesDeep layer of your coreMuscle fibers run horizontally and span from your lower ribs, lumbar fascia, front of your iliac crest, and inguinal ligament; connects to your lineaalba and your pubic boneWhile the diaphragm relaxing reduces tension allowing exhale –the transverse abs aid by pulling back in the abdominal organs which were pushed out by the diaphragm, helpful with a conscious or forced exhaleBEYOND THE LUNGS•Diffusion: the exchange of gases, occurs in the alveoli•Hemoglobin:oxygen attaches to red blood cells and is carried through the body•Cells:the oxygen from the blood combines with glucose to create cellular energy (ATP –adenosine triphosphate)•Mitochondria:the part of the cell where cellular respiration occursand energy is produced•VagusNerve C:The vagusnerve, also known as the vagal nerves, are the main nerves of your parasympathetic nervous system.
