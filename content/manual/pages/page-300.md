Pranayama 3 TYPES OF BREATHINGClavicular:an expansion of chest breathing (when belly breathing isn’t possible due to pregnancy or athletic core engagement) where clavicles lift to allow air to top of lungs.Thoracic:also known as chest breathing.The diaphragm is kept short and just the intercostal muscles work to expand and contract the diameter of the rib cage.This type of breathing is directly connected to the sympathetic nervous system and is effective for fight/flight.Diaphragmatic:also known as full or complete breathing.When the diaphragm is fully used,the bottom areas of the lungs, where most blood vessels are located, is used to create the most efficient exchange ofO2and CO2. For this contraction to fully happen, it’s necessary for the core muscles (primarily TA) to soften/contract long so that abdominal organs can move down and out.This type of breathing is directly connected to the parasympathetic nervous system.Breathing this way will take someone from fight/flight into rest/digest.NEW TO YOGA BREATHINGComplete Breath –requires conscious use of diaphragm, internal and external intercostals, and transverse abs –an excellent place to begin as most people haven’t used their diaphragms to breathe since they were infants:•Inhale –fill your belly•Exhale –empty your bellyVictorious Breath (Ujjayi) –gently tone the muscles of your throat to create a softly audible, oceanic sound•Like root lock, the muscular toning is very gentle –like the way a baby grasps your finger•Sound is audible to you, perhaps the person next to you, and not the person across the room•Like breathing through the nose instead of mouth –victorious breath will further narrow the passageway of air to travel through which will require greater energy and will result in warmingADVANCED PRACTICEBox Breath (Sama VrittiPranayama) (pictured)Supports the parasympathetic nervous system ”rest and digest” system, especially when stressed and if the sympathetic nervous system, ”fight or flight” system, aims to create equal breath pattern of the inhales and exhales, with a pause in between. The breath retention practice can be considered an advanced practice as it can be stress or anxiety inducing and not recommended for new practitioners.ExperienceCreate a “box” with your breath With equal parts of inhale, hold,exhale, hold
CONTRAINDICATIONSDiaphragmatic Breath:•Recent surgery to torsoUjjayi Breath:•Sore throat•Upper respiratory infectionGeneral Precautions:•Any negative physical or emotional effects (pain, anxiety, agitation), discontinue practice immediately•Consult with qualified yoga instructor or your physicianBreath Retentionis an advanced practice as it can trigger stress or anxiety, and students should always practice caution with any form of breath manipulation as it can cause physical and emotional reactions.
