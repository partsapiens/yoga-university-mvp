## 6.30 Chakras

**Chakra** translates as "wheel" or "disc" and refers to energetic clusters, or accumulation points in the subtle body. While there are many of these points in the body, there are seven major chakras located along the spinal column. Each chakra represents a basic level of human consciousness.

To appreciate the significance of the chakras, consider the location, element and seed sound or *bija mantra* and the lotus or mandala that is used to depict each one. The seed sound is to be chanted while a practitioner meditates on each chakra's symbolism, whether it be through an energetic quality, a deity associated, an element, bodily organ, color, or shape to create an experience or grow awareness of each of the chakras. 

Chakras are also represented by lotuses, symbolizing the unfolding of flower petals, which metaphorically describe the opening of a chakra. Lotus flowers are sacred in India. Growing from mud, they symbolize a path of development from a primitive being to fully blossoming. The base chakra rooted in the earth evolves into the 1,000-petal lotus flower at the crown of the head!

Through meditation or chanting of the seed sound and focus on the chakras, a practitioner connects to the energy or element of the chakras and awakens a path for prana to flow. We can then better understand ourselves, the world around us and the world within us. 

The seed sounds and elements of earth, water, fire, wind, space/ether are not just "places in [the] body…everything has one of the [seed] sounds and elements within them…and the spinal chord [is] a musical instrument to play these notes from" (Raja Choudhury).

Once awakened or open, it is said that one's kundalini (the sleeping serpent at the base of the spine) prana is awakened and there is a pathway to knowing our essential Self or *ānanda* (AAH-nun-duh), bliss.
