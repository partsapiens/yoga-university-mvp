It is of the nature of cognition, activity and rest, and is for thepurpose of experience and realization.19.The stages of the attributes effectingthe experienced world are the specialized and the unspecialized, the differentiated and the undifferentiated.20.The indweller is pure consciousness only,which though pure, sees through the mind and is identified by ego as being only the mind.21.The very existence of the seen is for the sake of the seer.22.Although Creation is discerned as not real for the one who has achieved the goal, it is yet real in that Creation remains the common experience to others.23.The association of the seer with Creation is for the distinct recognition of the objectiveworld, as well as for the recognition of the distinct nature of the seer.24.The cause of the association is ignorance.25.Liberation of the seer is the result of thedisassociation of the seer and the seen, with the disappearance of ignorance.26.The continuous practice of discrimination isthe means of attaining liberation.27.Steady wisdom manifests in seven stages.28.On the destruction of impurity by thesustained practice of the limbs of Union, the light of knowledge reveals the faculty of discrimination.29.The eight limbs of Union are self-restraintin actions, fixed observance, posture, regulation of energy, mind-control in sense engagements, concentration, meditation, and realization.30.Self-restraint in actions includes abstention from violence, from falsehoods, from stealing, from sexual engagements, and from acceptance of gifts.31.These five willing abstentions are not limited by rank, place, time or circumstance and constitute the Great Vow.32.The fixed observances are cleanliness,contentment, austerity, study and persevering devotion to God.33.When improper thoughts disturb the mind, there should be constant pondering over theopposites.34.Improper thoughts and emotions such as those of violence- whether done, caused to bedone, or even approved of - indeed, any thought originating in desire, anger or delusion, whether mild medium or intense - do all result in endless pain and misery. Overcome such distractions by pondering on the opposites.35.When one is confirmed in non-violence, hostility ceases in his presence.36.When one is firmly established in speaking truth, the fruits of action become subservient to him.37.All jewels approach him who is confirmed in honesty.38.When one is confirmed in celibacy, spiritual vigor is gained.39.When one is confirmed in non-possessiveness, the knowledge of the why and how of existence is attained.40.From purity follows a withdrawal from enchantment over one’s own body as well asa cessation of desire for physical contact with others.41.As a result of contentment there is purity of mind, one-pointedness, control of the senses, and fitness for the vision of the self.42.Supreme happiness is gained via contentment.6. 7© COREPOWER YOGA
