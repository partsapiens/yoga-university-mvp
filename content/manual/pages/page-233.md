Eupper body musclesERECTOR SPINAE A•Runs parallel to the spine, one on each side like bowling bumpers to help keep the spine erect•Contracting these muscles straightens or extends the spine,while contracting only one side will produce a rotational effectLATISSIMUS DORSI B•Broad triangle covering most of the back from the neck to the pelvis•Extends the arms (from a flexed position) and internally rotates and adducts the armsTRAPEZIUS C•Broad triangular-shaped muscle covering the upper and middle back•Contraction of the upper fibers elevates the scapula•Contraction of the middle fibers adducts the scapula, assisting the rhomboids in opening the chestRHOMBOIDS D•Originate from the spine and attached on the scapula (shoulder blade)•Draws the shoulder blades towards the midline and opens the chestSERRATUS ANTERIOR E•Primary role is to keep the scapula flush to the thorax or ribcage•This muscle has multiple heads, resembling feathers that adhere to the top nine ribs•Contraction of this muscle draws the scapula forward and away from the midline (e.g. punching)•Relaxing the Serratus Anterior allows the scapula to draw back towards the midline, opening the chest•Weakness in this muscle group shows in the “winging” of the shoulder blades in Chaturanga
