Carry it with you, explore its pages during class, reference it outside class, mark it up, write all over it, let the contents inspire you, and lead you to new places.

You are officially part of our community of CorePower Yoga teachers. We're so happy to have you with us, to guide you through this journey and watch you and your practice grow. Congrats on this commitment - you'll never look back.

## Program Commitments

### OUR COMMITMENT 

Yoga Flow Yoga is committed to providing you with an exceptional and practical teacher training program that follows the standards of Yoga Alliance. With the completion of your certification requirements and an optional Yoga Alliance Registration you will be qualified to market yourself as a yoga teacher in the greater yoga community. 

We will teach you to become a dynamic teacher, while at the same time giving you the opportunity to explore and discover the power within yourself. We are committed to educating you on how to understand yoga and teach yoga asana. In order to receive your certification you must meet all teacher training requirements.

If you would like to continue your yoga education with Yoga Flow Yoga following graduation, you have the option of enrolling in our Extensions Program.

### YOUR COMMITMENT

I commit to this program and Svādhyāya self-study in both mind and body. I am committed to the process of growth through Aparigraha or non-attachment and am open to exploring the many new directions that this teacher training will take me. 

I will challenge my current physical abilities in the pursuit of elevating my asana practice and will practice Tapas or self-discipline while seeking knowledge of the body and its movements. I will practice Asteya or non-stealing and will be on time and present in mind and body for lectures. I will let my teacher training lead, coach, and peers know in advance when I cannot attend. 

I will continue to support my own growth as well as the growth of the Yoga Flow Yoga community. I will practice Satya or truth and Ahimsā or non-judgment/non-harming in my feedback and in group discussion. I will practice Brahmacharya, moderation, Śaucha, clarity, and Santosha, contentment, in the pursuit of my goals. 

I acknowledge that the schedule is demanding and I will practice self-care throughout the program duration. I realize that this contract is solely with me and I will have no attachment to the outcome. I will be committed to the journey and my growth that will unfold in the process. I will get out of this training exactly what I put into it.

## TT Intention & Methodology

The intention of Yoga Flow Yoga Teacher Training is to take you on an inner journey of self-discovery, to strengthen your personal yoga practice and to share with you the skills to teach yoga and transform the lives of others.

Our teaching methodology focuses on practical experience to drive accelerated results during this training. Get ready to dive in headfirst! We use a formulaic approach to teaching that translates to accessible learning for you now and for your students in the future. 

We'll primarily study our foundational C1 sequence for the first half and learn more about sequencing beyond in the second half - you'll learn Yoga Asana, an Accessible Approach to customizing poses, and Teaching Tools like sequencing and theming. We'll explore lectures in Anatomy, Yoga History, Yogic Philosophy and inclusive teaching tools. We'll spend time in lecture, group discussion, workshops and of course, plenty of practice teaching!

Whether you decide to actually teach yoga or not, we are all lifelong teachers. Cultivating these life skills and observing the many other life lessons of yoga will heavily influence your life beyond your yoga asana practice, changing how you navigate situations, think, interact and connect with the world around you.

Let's nurture the physical, mental and spiritual health that come from a consistent yoga practice.

## Journals & Quizzes

During training, as part of your requirements you are expected to journal about every yoga practice, lecture and session in Yoga Flow University (YFU). Journaling is a great way to extend the classroom experience. Reflecting on your yoga practice will allow you to see how it relates to the content of your training.

Journaling is part of Svadhyaya (self-study) and is required to complete your certification.

You will journal about each class where you practice, each class you observe, each outside class and each large group lecture or classroom session. Keep a running class count and you have unlimited yoga during the program. We encourage you to start on these requirements as soon as you can.

### JOURNAL TIPS

- Reflect on your overall experience. How do you feel? What did you learn about your practice? What new things did you learn about guiding a class effectively?
- How did the instructor use energy, voice, their playlist or the environment (light, music, heat if applicable) to support their class?
- What cues were effective and why?
- What did the teacher speak to outside of the physical aspects of yoga (theme)?
- What is at least one learning you are taking away from this class experience?
- How did your teacher weave their theme into class?
- Did you receive any adjustments? What did they help you learn?
- Describe the Instructor's demonstrations. What was effective? Was anything less than effective or missed the mark according to your observation?

## Reading & Resources

Review the posture breakdowns for all postures. Pay special attention to the key points of alignment, OPTIONS and benefits of each posture.
