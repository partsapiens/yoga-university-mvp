WHAT IS A THEME? A theme can complete a class experience and create a mind body experience. Themes are universal and connect the physical practice and postures to life beyond the physical. One word or short phrase that is consistent through the practice may be explained in many different wayswith theme-inspired verbs, cues, metaphors or imagery. Choose a philosophical learning or a learning that is present to you.
