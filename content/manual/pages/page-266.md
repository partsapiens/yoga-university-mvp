6 .20© COREPOWER YOGA PranayamaPranayama is the fourth limb of the AshtangaYoga path. It’s all about guiding life force through the conscious expansion and extension of breath.Prana means life force or vital energy and Yama translates to guide to expansion, extension or constraint.The breath is an essential and foundationalcomponent to all yoga postures and is a prioritythroughout class. The breath should be artfully and consistently cued. Oxygen is the most vital nutrient in our bodies and essential for proper and efficient functioning of the entire body - our brain, nerves, muscles and internal organs. We could live for days without food and water, however without oxygen a few short minutes is fatal. The benefits of mindful breathing include:•Balances energy in the body and mind•Increases body, mind connection•Supplies fresh oxygen to the whole body, cells and muscles•Removal of waste products and toxins from our body•Expands and stretches the rib cage, lungs, core and back•Utilizes full lung capacity, increasing oxygen exchange rates•Calms or energizes the nervous system•Can reverse stress responses; tension,headaches, anxiety, concentration challengesPranayama is often practiced seated andindependent from physical yoga postures. In CorePower Yoga, we utilize a specific type ofpranayama to enliven and mindfully link postures in our practice.UJJAYI PRANAYAMAIn Sanskrit the prefix “ud” means upward orexpanding, and conveys a sense of preeminence or power. The suffix “jaya” means conquest or success and from another point of view, restraint. Sotogether - create a conscious, audible, victorious breath.This breath is achieved by slightly constrictingthe vocal chords or the back of the throat as you would when fogging up a mirror, then inhalingand exhaling through the constriction of thethroat with a closed mouth. This creates a slow, rhythmic breath that expands lung capacitythrough increasing the vacuum effect in the lungs and sending air into the bottom lobes where the efficiency of oxygen transfer is the greatest. The audible sound, and the slow, dynamic oxygenation of the blood and body, creates the victoriouspractice.Ujjayi Pranayama breath slows and smoothsthe flow of breath, which in and of itself would be sufficient benefit, but there is so much more value to utilizing this breath. Performing thistype of pranayama during asana practice focuses awareness on long slow breathing by constantregulation of the constriction at the back to the throat and the sound that it creates. The breath is slightly warmed through the friction the aircreates flowing over a slightly narrowed back ofthe throat which helps the body to oxygenate the blood efficiently. The slowing of the breath allows the bottom lobes of the lungs to fill and increases the breath capacity while providing more energy for the practitioner.The inhale is usually harder to keep a narrowthroat, but regain that shape with each exhaleand you will soon be able to maintain this slow and smooth breath continuously, even as you practice!
