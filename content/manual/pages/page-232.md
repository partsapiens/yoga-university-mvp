5.15 lower body muscles
There are several smaller muscles in your lower legs, all of which will be worked by focusing on the calves. There are two primarymuscle groups on the back of the lower legs (calf): gastrocnemius and soleus. When shortening in a contraction they point the toe(plantarflexion). On the front side of the lower leg you have the tibialis anterior muscle, which runs up the front of your shin and contracts to pull your foot and toes upward (dorsiflexion), theopposite movement of the calves.QUADRICEPS C•Group of four muscles that sit on the front of the thigh: vastus lateralis, medialis and intermedius, rectus femoris•They extend (straighten) the knee and flex (bend) the hip when they shorten in a contractionHAMSTRINGS D•Three muscles: semimembranosus, semitendinosus, biceps femoris•Originates at the sits bones and runs down to the lower side of the knee joint•Primarily functions when they shorten in a contraction are knee flexion (bringing the heel towards the glutes) and hip and thigh extension (moving the leg back)GLUTEALS E•Three muscles: gluteus minimus, medius, maximus•The ‘gluteus maximus’ is one of the strongest muscles in the body and covers a large part of the buttock•It connects the pelvis, sacrum, and tailbone to the thigh bone (femur) by soft tissues of the thigh and acts to extend, abduct and rotate the hip•Causes the leg to straighten at the hip when a person walks, runs, or climbs•Used to raise the body from a sitting positionADDUCTOR GROUP F•A group of five muscles: pectineus, longus, brevis, magnus, gracilis•Largest is magnus, which supports and can accentuate Mula Bandha (Pelvic Floor)•Contraction adducts the hips, pulls toward the midline
