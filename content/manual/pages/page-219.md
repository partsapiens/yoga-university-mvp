5.2 © COREPOWER YOGA THE PHYSICAL BODYDynamic activities like yoga increase bloodflow through the body, which heats and loosens connective tissue. Heat enhances the tissue’sability to soften and relax so it is beneficial to stretch after the muscles have been warmedup. Due to the nature and characteristics of the connective tissue, a yoga practice can target onearea of the body, while positively affecting another area.With the complementary muscular length andstrength benefits of yoga, a balanced yoga practice can improve posture and structural alignment bybalancing the muscular and soft-tissue tension pulling on opposite sides of a joint. Yoga helps tobuild multi-joint coordination, and with increasedpull at muscle-tendon-bone attachment sites, yoga can increase a person’s bone density.ALIGNMENTA basic knowledge of bone and muscle alignment, as well as how to stack the joints, is essential for injury prevention in yoga. A simple understanding of bone/muscle function and joint placementteaches efficiency in yoga and effortlessness of movement. By using proper alignment techniques to create efficiency of movement, yoga has many wonderful physiological effects on the body.Improper alignment causes undue stress on the body. Distortion of the joints can result in joint degeneration, and excessive load to supportingstructures (tendons, ligaments, cartilage, menisci). With repeated improper alignment and isolated or imbalanced excessive loading patterns, ligaments can overstretch, joint capsules can loosen andcartilage may wear out over time.Forward-head posture is currently one of the mostcommon abnormal postures in our society and occurs when a person’s head position is shifted forward relative toAnatomy is more than just the sum of all of the parts and systems of the body. While the body is perfect, the science of anatomy is imperfect.It lacks depth and dynamic relationship between the systems of the body and the individuality of each of us. The information provided here is abrief introduction to the physical make-up of the body. Understanding the functional anatomy,or relationship of how the body moves through yoga asana helps us understand the body moreintimately and opens our minds to the magnificent interplay of our physical beings.A basic knowledge and functional understanding of anatomical structures allows an instructor tosafely guide students in and out of yoga postures, while respecting natural skeletal joint structure, function, range of motion and muscle lengths;honoring structural integrity and facilitating injury prevention.Translated, vinyasa literally means “to place in a special way” or “to move with intention.”Together, a functional understanding of anatomy and appreciation for the physical intention of the yoga posture provides an instructor the abilityto skillfully personalize or modify a posture for a student with a physical limitation or injury, while staying aligned with the overall physical intention of the pose. This knowledgeable andmindful instructor facilitates a safe and successful yoga experience for the student. In addition,understanding the skeletal system’s structuralintegrity, the physical intention of the poses and exercises and the behavior of the anatomicalstructures involved in achieving a given pose or exercise, allows a teacher to choose verbal cuesthat strengthen a student’s awareness, alignment and connection to the asana. Understandinganatomy is paramount to educated body-reading and cueing as a teacher.Anatomy In Yoga
