# Muscles

under the fascia in Yoga and create mobility.- If we allow any part of our bodies to remainimmobile, the fascia become less flexible and eventually restrict our movement. Posturalimbalances are largely due to imbalances in the fascia and tensegrity of the system.- Individuals vary in the density of their fascia tissue, impacting natural flexibility.LIGAMENTS C- Connects bone to bone at a joint- Thicker version of fascia- They stabilize the joint as well as control mobility- Vary in size and shape according to their function- Have limited to no elasticity. Over stretching or injury to ligaments compromises the stabilitypotential of a joint.TENDONS D- Connect muscle to bone (connects fascia of the muscles to fascia of the bones)- Thicker version of fascia

5.12 © Yoga Flow YOGA MusclesMuscles are elastic tissue fibers organized in bundled shapes throughout the body. Smallmovements don’t require every muscle fiber to be working, whereas bigger movements require many or all of the muscle fibers. The more you practice a pose, the more muscle fibers are engaged tostrengthen a muscle group.STRUCTURE and FUNCTION A- Muscle fibers are what cause a muscle to contract.- Muscle fibers contract in response to nervestimuli from the central nervous system sent from the brain.- This is a process involving the release of Calcium from the bones to the muscle.- The release of Calcium causes an effect which results in the shortening or contraction of theindividual muscle fiber which in turn affects the contraction of the entire muscle.- The force of the contraction transmits the force to the bones and moves the joint.Gastocnemius # Soleus # Tibialis Anterior # Quadriceps # Hamstrings # Gluteals # Adductors # Rectus Abdominis # Obliques # Transverse Abdominis # Erector Spinae # Latissimus Dorsi # Trapezius # Rhomboids # Serratus Anterior # Deltoids # Rotator Cuff # Pectoralis # Biceps # Triceps #

5.14 © Yoga Flow YOGA CONTRACTIONS When a muscle contracts, the brain sends a signal to the muscle that tells the fibers to lengthen,shorten or stay strong in a static position.1.Concentric - Muscle engagement during active muscle shortening.2.Eccentric - Muscle engagement during active muscle lengthening.3.Isometric - Muscle engagement under constant muscle length without movement.Example of Concentric to Eccentric AThe brain tells the rectus abdominals that it is time to perform a crunch. The rectus abdominal fibers shorten,causing the spine to flex and the chest to lift off the floor into a crunch. This is a concentric contraction for therectus abdominals. When lowering the chest back down to the starting position, the rectus abdominals contract eccentrically to lower the torso back to the ground with control.Example of Eccentric to Concentric BWhen lowering into a chaturanga, the triceps muscle works eccentrically (while lengthening) to control the elbowflexion (bending) during the lowering phase (high to low) of a chaturanga push-up. It must in order to fight to force of gravity. The triceps works concentrically to produce elbow extension to raise the body back up from low to High Plank position.MUSCLE BALANCE Muscle balance is the relationship between the Agonist and Antagonist. It is important to have muscle balance to prevent injury. If the Agonist is much stronger than the Antagonist, the Agonist can overpower and injure the Antagonist. Muscle imbalance is quite common. Know commonimbalances found in the average student and ways you can encourage through Yoga muscle balance.- Agonist - The primary muscle(s) responsible for the desired motion at a joint- Antagonist - Muscle(s) directly opposite (on the other side of the joint) as the agonist/primemover- Stabilizers - These muscles hold a joint in place while the exercise is being performed and the main muscles are supported. The stabilizersmuscles are not necessarily moving during an exercise, but provide stationary support.- Co-contraction - Agonist and Antagonist are simultaneously active. Muscle co-contraction increases joint stability and facilitates joint control.Every muscle has an opposing muscle group. For Example, Bicep to Tricep, Pectoralis toTrapezius, Quadriceps to Hamstrings, Rectus Abdominals to Erector Spinae

5.15 lower body muscles
There are several smaller muscles in your lower legs, all of which will be worked by focusing on the calves. There are two primarymuscle groups on the back of the lower legs (calf): gastrocnemius and soleus. When shortening in a contraction they point the toe(plantarflexion). On the front side of the lower leg you have the tibialis anterior muscle, which runs up the front of your shin and contracts to pull your foot and toes upward (dorsiflexion), theopposite movement of the calves.QUADRICEPS C- Group of four muscles that sit on the front of the thigh: vastus lateralis, medialis and intermedius, rectus femoris- They extend (straighten) the knee and flex (bend) the hip when they shorten in a contractionHAMSTRINGS D- Three muscles: semimembranosus, semitendinosus, biceps femoris- Originates at the sits bones and runs down to the lower side of the knee joint- Primarily functions when they shorten in a contraction are knee flexion (bringing the heel towards the glutes) and hip and thigh extension (moving the leg back)GLUTEALS E- Three muscles: gluteus minimus, medius, maximus- The ‘gluteus maximus’ is one of the strongest muscles in the body and covers a large part of the buttock- It connects the pelvis, sacrum, and tailbone to the thigh bone (femur) by soft tissues of the thigh and acts to extend, abduct and rotate the hip- Causes the leg to straighten at the hip when a person walks, runs, or climbs- Used to raise the body from a sitting positionADDUCTOR GROUP F- A group of five muscles: pectineus, longus, brevis, magnus, gracilis- Largest is magnus, which supports and can accentuate Mula Bandha (Pelvic Floor)- Contraction adducts the hips, pulls toward the midline

Eupper body musclesERECTOR SPINAE A- Runs parallel to the spine, one on each side like bowling bumpers to help keep the spine erect- Contracting these muscles straightens or extends the spine,while contracting only one side will produce a rotational effectLATISSIMUS DORSI B- Broad triangle covering most of the back from the neck to the pelvis- Extends the arms (from a flexed position) and internally rotates and adducts the armsTRAPEZIUS C- Broad triangular-shaped muscle covering the upper and middle back- Contraction of the upper fibers elevates the scapula- Contraction of the middle fibers adducts the scapula, assisting the rhomboids in opening the chestRHOMBOIDS D- Originate from the spine and attached on the scapula (shoulder blade)- Draws the shoulder blades towards the midline and opens the chestSERRATUS ANTERIOR E- Primary role is to keep the scapula flush to the thorax or ribcage- This muscle has multiple heads, resembling feathers that adhere to the top nine ribs- Contraction of this muscle draws the scapula forward and away from the midline (e.g. punching)- Relaxing the Serratus Anterior allows the scapula to draw back towards the midline, opening the chest- Weakness in this muscle group shows in the “winging” of the shoulder blades in Chaturanga

5.18 © Yoga Flow YOGA TRANSVERSE ABDOMINUS B- Transverse Abs are the most over-looked abdominal muscle- Deepest of your ab muscles- Belt, girdle, corset of torso- Critical muscle to help build core strength- By strengthening and toning this muscle you help strengthen your core and back, minimizing backinjury and pain- Engaging the Transverse Abs feels like bracing your body as if someone was going to try and tip you over (squeeze in with yourmuscles rather than out)- Always include abdominal exercises that work this muscle for example, boat posePSOAS C- Rope like muscle that connects the lumbar spine (low back) to the anterior (front) of the femur (thigh bone)- Connects front body to back body and lower body to upper body- Primarily serves as a hip flexor muscle, drawing the thigh bone up toward the lower abdomen- Flexes and externally rotates the leg at the hip (also flexes the trunk, tilts the pelvis forward to straighten and support the spine)abdominal muscles
ACB Abdominal muscles extend from different placeson the ribs to various places on the pelvis and their primary purpose is to provide movement and tosupport your trunk. Six different muscles make up the front body abdominal wall.RECTUS ABDOMINUS A- Commonly referred to as the “six-pack”- Separated and supported by fascial pockets- Long flat muscle running down midline of the core- One long muscle covering what people commonly refer to as the lower abs and upper abs.- Main purpose and function when shortened in a contraction is to pull the lower ribs towards the pelvis as in crunchesOBLIQUES- Four oblique muscles: 2 external, 2 internal- Located on each side of the body and wraps around like a basket weave of muscle fibers- Main function is for twisting and side bending the body at your torso- Internal and external oblique muscles worktogether but in opposite ways. When twisting your body to the right you use and contractthe right internal oblique muscle and the left external oblique muscles- Abdominal exercises that twist or bend at the side will work your oblique muscles like bicycle crunches, side bends
