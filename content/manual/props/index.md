NEC Kparticularly in Shoulder Stand and Bridge PoseMake sure that once up in the pose, the student does not turn his or her head from side to side. This can twist and aggravate the cervical spine.LOWER BACK and LUMBA Rparticularly in forward bendsLower back pain can be a problem when the body is not sufficiently warmed up or open.If the hamstring muscles are tight, work withpostures that gently loosen the hamstrings before attempting strong forward bends.LOWER BAC Kparticularly in backbendsLower back pain can be a problem if done when the body is not sufficiently warmed up or open.Teach backbends in stages and only practice full backbends and advanced versions if students aresufficiently open in the hip flexors, chest, shoulder and spine.KNEE STRAIN If the hips are not open, the knees and eventhe ankles will take the strain. As a precaution,practice hip opening postures before deep flexion of the knees.HAMSTRINGS The hamstrings can be injured in forward bends and hip opening postures. With minor tears it isbest to continue working the area to keep mobility and encourage healing. Other tears require restand then gentle stretching into the area.WRISTS The wrists can become sore and swollen when applying pressure in poses such as Downward Facing Dog. This usually indicates weak wrist muscles; as practice continues, the wrists will strengthen and the pain will pass.
