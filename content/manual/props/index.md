If using astrap, instruct how to loop the strap and where the strap should touch the body.- Describe what you will be doing and WHY. There is no purpose to using a prop if your studentsdon’t learn something from it!- Demonstrate. Move around the room to see that your intention is captured by your students.- Read the room. Ask yourself what purpose the extra support from using a prop is serving. Let that answer guide the way you use it. Practice First- Be comfortable with using the prop- Be able to demonstrate with confidence- Use clear, succinct and direct cues Try New Things- Keep your students from hitting plateaus- Stimulates your students’ growth- Encourage students to come back for more Be Flexible- Let go if a student doesn’t seem interested- Don’t worry if some students choose not to use the path you provide

NEC Kparticularly in Shoulder Stand and Bridge Pose Make sure that once up in the pose, the student does not turn his or her head from side to side. This can twist and aggravate the cervical spine. LOWER BACK and LUMBA Rparticularly in forward bends Lower back pain can be a problem when the body is not sufficiently warmed up or open. If the hamstring muscles are tight, work withpostures that gently loosen the hamstrings before attempting strong forward bends. LOWER BAC Kparticularly in backbends Lower back pain can be a problem if done when the body is not sufficiently warmed up or open. Teach backbends in stages and only practice full backbends and advanced versions if students aresufficiently open in the hip flexors, chest, shoulder and spine. KNEE STRAIN If the hips are not open, the knees and eventhe ankles will take the strain. As a precaution, practice hip opening postures before deep flexion of the knees. HAMSTRINGS The hamstrings can be injured in forward bends and hip opening postures. With minor tears it isbest to continue working the area to keep mobility and encourage healing. Other tears require restand then gentle stretching into the area. WRISTS The wrists can become sore and swollen when applying pressure in poses such as Downward Facing Dog. This usually indicates weak wrist muscles; as practice continues, the wrists will strengthen and the pain will pass.
