WHY REST?The Surrender series is an important part of most yoga asana classes and it is common for this part to be challenging for new practitioners because of its emphasis on slowing down and stillness. In a 60-minute Yoga Flow Yoga class, this series includes Savasana, which at minimum should be held for two minutes.
