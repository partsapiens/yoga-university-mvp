# Generate Flow (Yoga Flow Builder)

This is a standalone page for composing, previewing, and playing yoga sequences. It is built with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **Auto-generation**: Create a yoga sequence based on a specified duration, intensity, and focus area.
- **Customization**: Manually add, remove, and reorder poses. Adjust the duration for each pose individually.
- **Playback**: Play the sequence with a timer, progress bars, and Text-to-Speech (TTS) cues.
- **Persistence**: Save your favorite flows to your device for later use.
- **Voice Control**: Use your voice to control the page settings via the AI assistant, or guide your practice with the Voice Coach widget.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

While the main player is active, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts:

| Key           | Action                               |
