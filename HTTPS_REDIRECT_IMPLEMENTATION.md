# HTTP to HTTPS Redirect Implementation

## Problem Statement

The site was accessible over both `http://` and `https://`, but the insecure HTTP version did not automatically redirect to the secure HTTPS version. This affects:

- **Security**: Users accessing via HTTP send data unencrypted
- **SEO**: Search engines prefer sites that enforce HTTPS
- **User Trust**: Modern browsers show warnings for HTTP sites

## Solution

Implemented a 301 (permanent) redirect from HTTP to HTTPS at the platform level using Netlify configuration.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Netlify Configuration (`netlify.toml`)

Added redirect rules to force HTTPS for all traffic:

```toml
# HTTP to HTTPS redirect (301 permanent)
# Ensures all traffic uses secure HTTPS protocol
[[redirects]]
  from = "http://fltwht.com/*"
  to = "https://fltwht.com/:splat"
  status = 301
  force = true

[[redirects]]
  from = "http://www.fltwht.com/*"
  to = "https://fltwht.com/:splat"
  status = 301
  force = true
```

**Why this approach:**
- Netlify handles redirects at the edge (CDN level) for maximum performance
- `status = 301` indicates a permanent redirect (good for SEO)
- `force = true` ensures the redirect happens even if there's a matching path
- `:splat` preserves the full path after the domain

#### 2. Next.js Configuration (`next.config.js`)

Added a documentation comment to note that HTTP to HTTPS redirects are handled at the platform level, not in Next.js redirects.

## Verification

After deployment, you can verify the redirect is working:

```bash
# Should redirect to HTTPS with 301 status
curl -I http://fltwht.com

# Should show HTTP/2 200 (already HTTPS)
curl -I https://fltwht.com
```

Or test in browser:
1. Visit `http://fltwht.com` (without the 's')
2. Browser should automatically redirect to `https://fltwht.com`
3. Check browser address bar shows `https://` and a lock icon

## Benefits

✅ **Security**: All traffic now uses encrypted HTTPS  
✅ **SEO**: Search engines will index the HTTPS version  
✅ **User Trust**: Browsers show the site as secure  
✅ **Performance**: Redirects happen at CDN edge, minimal latency  
✅ **Standards Compliance**: Follows modern web security best practices  

## Alternative Implementations

### For Other Platforms

If deploying on different platforms, here are equivalent configurations:

#### Vercel (`vercel.json`)
```json
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/:path*",
      "has": [
        {
          "type": "header",
          "key": "x-forwarded-proto",
          "value": "http"
        }
      ],
      "destination": "https://fltwht.com/:path*",
      "permanent": true
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Apache (`.htaccess`)
```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
```

#### Nginx (server block)
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name fltwht.com www.fltwht.com;
    return 301 https://fltwht.com$request_uri;
}
```
