KDELTOIDS F•Three muscles: posterior, lateral and anterior•Together the three muscles abduct the shoulder joint•Anterior fibers: shoulder flexion and horizontal adduction•Posterior fibers: shoulder extension and horizontal abductionROTATOR CUFF G•Shallow ball and socket joint; these four muscles help to stabilize, they don’t offer “great” mobility•Supraspinatus: draws the head of the humerus to the midline,against the glenoid fossa and first bit of shoulder abduction before the deltoids kick in•Infraspinatus: draws the head of the humerus to the midline, against the glenoid fossa and external rotation•Teres minor: draws the head of the humerus to the midline, against the glenoid fossa and external rotation•Subscapularus: draws the head of the humerus to the midline, against the glenoid fossa and Internal rotationCHEST H•Two pectoral muscles: Major and minor (big and small)•Pulls the arm towards the midline•Upper clavicular fibers flex the shoulder joint•Sternal fibers draw the arm toward the midline: horizontal adductionBICEPS J•2 Biceps run down the anterior (front) side of the humerus (upper arm bone)•Primary function is to bend the elbow (elbow flexion)•Secondary function is supination of the forearm-turning the hand from a palms-down position to a palms-up positionTRICEPS K•Triceps consist of three “heads”•Main function of the triceps is to extend (straighten) the elbow•Being a two joint muscle, secondary function is to extend the shoulder</p>
