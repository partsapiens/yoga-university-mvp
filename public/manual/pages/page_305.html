<p>Implicit Bias”Our preferences -what and whom we favor or reject…can take different forms…psychologists routinely speak about two systems that characterize the mind: reflective and automatic.” (Banaji and Mahzarin, 2016, p 53*)“Everyday automatic preferences steer us towards less conscious decisions…our rationality is often no match for our automatic preference” (Banaji and Mahzarin, 2016, p 54*)AUTOMATIC PROGRAMMING Our preferences can stem from the mind being reflective -reflecting on our our values, such as life, education, religious beliefs, experience, and automatic, or implicit, non-conscious decision making. The automatic, part of our mind also informs our thoughts and feelings and actions, but in a way that we might not be able to explain or notice as clearly. The danger arises when the implicit or automatic part of our mind has a bigger, and potentially negative, impact. EXPLICIT BIASExplicit bias is the traditional conceptualization of bias. With explicit bias, individuals are aware of their prejudices and attitudes toward certain groups. Positive or negative preferences for a particular group are conscious. Overt racism and racist comments are examples of explicit biases.*IMPLICIT OR UNCONSCIOUS BIASImplicit bias involves all ofthe subconscious feelings, perceptions, attitudes, and stereotypes that have developed as a result ofprior influences and imprints. It is an automatic positive or negative preference for a group, based on one’s subconscious thoughts. However, implicit bias does not require animus; it only requires knowledge of a stereotype to produce discriminatory actions. Implicit bias can be just as problematic as explicit bias, because both may produce discriminatory behavior. With implicit bias, the individual may be unaware that biases, rather than the facts of a situation, are driving their decision-making.*Affinity Bias –tendency to warm up and give preference with people who we believe are like usConfirmation Bias –tendency to seek information that confirm our pre-existing beliefs and values304reflectionWhat is an experience (in your life or as a yoga student) you’ve had where you were felt seen, valued, safe? Conversely, what does it feel like when we are not seen, valued, safe?
How may this experience inspire the kind of space you want to create for your yoga students? And what qualities does a yoga teacher need to develop to provide that space?
What can be gained from a more inclusive yoga community?
