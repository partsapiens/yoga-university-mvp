<h3>YOUR COMMITMENT</h3>
<p>I commit to this program and Svādhyāya self-study in both mind and body. I am committed to the process of growth through Aparigraha or non-attachment and am open to exploring the many new directions that this teacher training will take me.</p>

<p>I will challenge my current physical abilities in the pursuit of elevating my asana practice and will practice Tapas or self-discipline while seeking knowledge of the body and its movements. I will practice Asteya or non-stealing and will be on time and present in mind and body for lectures. I will let my teacher training lead, coach, and peers know in advance when I cannot attend.</p>

<p>I will continue to support my own growth as well as the growth of the Yoga Flow Yoga community. I will practice Satya or truth and Ahimsā or non-judgment/non-harming in my feedback and in group discussion. I will practice Brahmacharya, moderation, Śaucha, clarity, and Santosha, contentment, in the pursuit of my goals.</p>

<p>I acknowledge that the schedule is demanding and I will practice self-care throughout the program duration.

<h2>TT Intention & Methodology</h2>
<p>The intention of Yoga Flow Yoga Teacher Training is to take you on an inner journey of self-discovery, to strengthen your personal yoga practice and to share with you the skills to teach yoga and transform the lives of others.</p>

<p>Our teaching methodology focuses on practical experience to drive accelerated results during this training. Get ready to dive in headfirst! We use a formulaic approach to teaching that translates to accessible learning for you now and for your students in the future.</p>

<p>We'll primarily study our foundational C1 sequence for the first half and learn more about sequencing beyond in the second half - you'll learn Yoga Asana, an Accessible Approach to customizing poses, and Teaching Tools like sequencing and theming. We'll explore lectures in Anatomy, Yoga History, Yogic Philosophy and inclusive teaching tools. We'll spend time in lecture, group discussion, workshops and of course, plenty of practice teaching!</p>

<p>Whether you decide to actually teach yoga or not, we are all lifelong teachers. Cultivating these life skills and observing the many other life lessons of yoga will heavily influence your life beyond your yoga asana practice, changing how you navigate situations, think, interact and connect with the world around you.</p>

<p>Let's nurture the physical, mental and spiritual health that come from a consistent yoga practice.</p>
