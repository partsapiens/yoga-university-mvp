It’s your job to create a space where your students feel comfortable and can approach each posture with ease. Keep your cues simple and easy to follow because beginners will only hear the first few things you say, then they will naturallymove their attention to their own bodies ratherthan your voice. The Basic Formula, Breath Posture Cue, provides a consistent template that both you and your students can rely on throughout class.Breath > Posture > Cue1.Say the Breath - Inhale or Exhale2.Say the name of the Posture3.Give Cues to move students into the postureFundamental Formulas
BPCCUE FORMULAGreat teachers select the fewest, most powerful cues to set their student up for success in each pose. The Cue Formula gives you the tools to setup your students for success. These cues can help setup a transition, setup a pose or deepen the pose. These three types of cues all rely on the Cue Formula:Verb > Your > Body Part > Direction1.Start with a Verb2.Use the qualifier “Your” to create connection with your students3.Select a Body Part using common vernacular rather than anatomical names that might be unfamiliar4.Give a clear DirectiontomovetowardsortoTransition CuesTransition cues help give clarity on how the student should move between poses. Transition cues can be engaged or disengaged from breath. For example:From Downward Facing Dog to Forward Fold“Inhale, look forward. Exhale, walk to the top of your mat.”From Ragdoll“Release your fingertips to the mat. Toe-heel your feet together.”Setup CuesUse essential cues to help your students move into the general shape of the pose. For example:In Warrior Two, first cue the feet and legs then move the spine, arms and head into the pose.“Spin your back heel down. Lift your chest to face the side of your space. Reach your arms forward and back. Gaze towards your front hand. Deepening CuesSelect cues that help your student move deeper into the pose once they’re already in the generalform. These cues can also be Muscle Action or Theme Action cues. For example: In Extended Side Angle“Draw your tailbone toward your back heel.”“Reach up with your top hand to engage your obliques.”</p>
