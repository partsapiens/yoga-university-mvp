<p>5.21 the shape of your bones and the mass of the softtissue in between. We see this when you place your palms flat on the mat like in Downward FacingDog.Shoulder CompressionFLEXION: humerus to acromionThe humerus can reach above your head only as far back as the acromion process, where yourcollar bone attached to the top of your shoulder blade. When the humerus hits the boney place where the collar bone and shoulder blade meet, it experiences compression. The only way toexperience more shoulder flexion is to abduct the arms and go around the acromion process, asseen when widening the arms more than shoulder distance. We see this in Tadasana.Spinal CompressionLATERAL FLEXION: ribcage on the iliac crest of the pelvisThe natural height of the lumbar spine willdetermine the amount of space between your bottom rib and the top of your pelvis. Whenside bending, a shorter lumbar spine will yield compression of the ribs to the pelvis, limiting further movement. If you are not experiencingcompression, where will you feel the stretch? How else will spine length affect our students’ poses?Spine length vs. femur length in twisting poses like in Prayer Twist.Hip CompressionIn the hips, compression is rarely strict bonedirectly on bone but often soft tissue compression.ROTATION: femur on hip socketMany of us are predisposed to be more naturalinternal rotators or external rotators based on the shape and position of our hip socket. When your femur bone makes contact with the edge of yourhip socket, that is compression. We see external rotation in Baddha Konasana and internal rotation in back leg of Warrior 1 or both legs in Fixed Firm Pose.FLEXION, ABDUCTION, ADDUCTION: femur on pelvis The femur bone compresses against the bones of the pelvis, often with soft tissue in between.Because the hip is a ball and socket joint, this can happen in more than one plane of motion. Wesee flexion in Forward Fold and Half-Pigeon. If you are not experiencing compression, where will you feel the stretch? We see abduction in Horse and Warrior two. If you are not experiencingcompression, where will you feel the stretch?We see adduction in Supine Twist. If you are not experiencing compression, where will you feel the stretch? How does the hip affect knee safety inthese poses?Ankle CompressionDORSIFLEXION: front ankle bones on front of tibiaWe see this in Downward Facing Dog. If you are not experiencing compression, where will you feel the stretch?PLANTARFLEXION: heel bone onto the back of tibia We see this in Child’s Pose and Upward Facing Dog. If you are not experiencing compression, where will you feel the stretch?</p>
