<p>5.19 Reading Different BodiesAs human beings our bodies are similar in many ways. Similar bones, joints and soft tissuestructures carry us through the postures of life. There are also differences inherent in each body and understanding these differences is important to being a good yoga teacher.When learning to instruct a group of people in class, focus on the foundations of alignment tokeep your students safe. Look for LOOK FOR and choose cues based on what you see in yourstudent’s body. Since each body is different, poses will naturally look and feel different for everyone.It is important to understand some of the reasons why we see so much variety in postures fromstudent to student. Variances in the body’s genetic structure play a role including bone shape, bodyproportion, strength and length in soft tissueand muscle and fat tissue mass. Present or past injuries, lifestyle, emotional state and bodyawareness are also factors. Understanding some of these variances will give you confidence in your cues as well as precision in the instruction you are able to offer your students.What makes our pose look different?

As teachersit is our job to serve both the strong and flexible students and help them discover balance in allparts of themselves. By understanding geneticpre-dispositions we can treat each student as an individual and help them practice self-acceptance regardless of what their poses look like.Some people are naturally more flexible than others thanks to connective tissue genetics.Our muscles, fascia, ligaments and tendonscarry within them a genetic make-up that pre-determines the density of our soft tissue and the ease with which it naturally stretches. The genetic make-up is important to understand so we canteach our students to appreciate their individual bodies and not compare themselves to otheryogis in the class. Of course, lifestyle habits will have much to do with a student’s flexibility when they first step onto a yoga mat, but their natural genetic disposition will also always be present.Collagen and ElastinCollagen is made up of protein. It is firm, strong and resistant to stretching. A student with more collagen fibers in their connective tissue willnaturally be stronger and less flexible. Elastinis made of up fibers that are thin, stretchy and flexible like elastic. A person with more elastin in their connective tissue will be more naturally flexible.Ground SubstanceThe ground substance is the jelly like substancethat the collagen and elastin live in. When the body is cold, this ground substance firms and becomesless supple, restricting movement in the connective tissue. When you warm the body up, the ground© COREPOWER YOGA</p>
