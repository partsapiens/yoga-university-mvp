<p>Cultural Appreciation and ContextDEFINING CULTURE AIn order to discuss the impact of cultural appreciation, we need a working definition of the word “Culture.” Culture can defined as a commonality based on different factors, like those pictured here. This is important as culture goes beyond what we may think on the surface. We may have several different cultures we navigate: a family culture, work culture, and a number of many other socially constructed cultures. Photos by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND
