Meditation is a method of bringing yourselves to a place of restful attention in which you are more receptive and responsive to the world around you. Oldestdocumentedevidence of the practice of meditation are wall arts in the Indian subcontinent from approximately 5,000 to 3,500 BCE, showing people seated in meditative postures with half-closed eyesOldest written mention of meditation is from 1,500 BCE in the Vedas. The BrihadAranyaka Upanishad(f14th century BCE) lists nearly 70 generations of meditation gurus and students.

(Yoga Sūtra1.2)There are many forms of meditation including Buddhist forms, and Hindu, and Kabalistic, and Jewish meditations, and Christian mystical, and Sufi, and Muslim, and Baha'i, and Zoroaster, and many more. 6th century BCE, Siddhartha Gautama (later to be known as the Buddha) left his royal life as a prince and set out to attain Enlightenment. Over the next several centuries, Buddhism spread all over Asia, and many different lineages were formed, such as the Buddhist styles of meditation (Vipassana), Loving-Kindness and Walking Meditation. Vipassana Insight meditation is at the heart of the teachings of awakening. Its purpose is to strengthen our capacity to experience “things as they are” directly, without the filter of thinking, judging or reacting. It consists of bringing a clear attention to whatever occurs in the present moment. There are many forms of Vipassana.
