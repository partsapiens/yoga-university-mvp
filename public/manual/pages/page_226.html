<p>ACTIVITYBend forward. This is lumbar flexion followed by forward tilting of thepelvis at the hip joints (“duck butt” movement). Stand upright and bend forward again. Notice that theseare two separate movements of the body, low back forward folding and forward tilting of the pelvis. These motions must happen at the sametime in any forward fold to be safe on the low back, otherwise we unsafely put pressure on the lumbar spinaldiscs. If there is not enough length in the hamstrings, the knees mustbe bent to create slack for the pelvis to tilt forward. Initiate a return tothe standing posture by the reverse movement - the backwards tiltingof the pelvis at the hips followed by extension (opposite of a forwardfold) of the lumbar spine to return to neutral.
