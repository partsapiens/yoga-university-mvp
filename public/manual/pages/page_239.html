<p>5.22 © COREPOWER YOGA Nervous SystemSENSORY DIVISIONSensory receptors are divided into three classes based either on their location in the body or the location of the stimuli to which they respond, exteroceptors, that take in external stimuli,interoceptors; that take in internal stimuli, and proprioceptors, that help us monitor where our body is in space.Proprioceptors are located in the musculoskeletal organs such as skeletal muscles, tendons, jointsand ligaments. Proprioceptors monitor the degree of stretch within each of these structures andsend input on the body movements to the CNS. Proprioception is the body’s awareness of where it is in space and the movement of its limbs. The nervous system is constantly communicatingan awareness of the length and tension of each muscle and the location of the limbs. This is whybalance poses are so challenging when the eyes are closed. When not relying on the eyes, the nervoussystem must locate the body’s center of gravity and figure out where it is in space.The body can create holding patterns to protect muscles from fatigue. Some muscles are stuckin shortened positions because of habitual,imbalanced postures. For example, some people’s shoulders are stuck up toward their ears without their knowledge. If you tried holding your shoulder up towards your ear all day, you would find thatit’s much harder to consciously engage a muscle. Some muscles disengage, making others engage in their place. These improper patterns can oftenbe reset with awareness and repetition of correct movements through yoga. Showing a muscle its full range of motion is enough to reset it to itsproper length.The nervous system is the master control and communication system of the body - everythought, action, instinct and emotion reflects its activity. The nervous system is made up of fiber bundles that weave throughout the body, muchlike fascia. The nervous systems cells communicate through rapid and specific electrical signalssent through these fibers, which produce almost immediate responses. By stretching and movingthe nerve fibers while allowing the body and mind to experience the full journey of a yoga class, we can help our students fight disease, stress andincrease overall feelings of well-being.FUNCTIONS•Uses millions of sensory receptors to monitor changes occurring both inside and outside of the body•Processes and interprets the sensory input to make decisions about what should be done at each moment•Dictates a response by activating the effector organs (muscles or glands)TYPES OF NERVE CELLSThe Central Nervous System (CNS) is theintegrating and command center of the nervous system. Consisting of the brain and the spinal cord, the CNS receives and interprets incoming sensory signals and dictates motor responsesbased on past experiences, reflexes and current conditions.The Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) consists mainly of nerves extending out from the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. These communication channels link all regions of the body to the CNS.</p>
