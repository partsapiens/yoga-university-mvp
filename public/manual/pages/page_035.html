<p>2.14 A demo in class is when a teacher demonstrates a pose to reveal particular alignment, effort orapproach to the students. This teaching tool allows you to share a lot of information in a short amount of time. Use concise language and feel free topoint or draw awareness to specific areas of the pose. Consider using the same language you willsubsequently use to cue your students through the pose for emphasis.FULL DEMOPut your students into a comfortable position(kneeling, sitting, standing at attention) and stop class to demonstrate the posture. Move to theplace in the classroom that offers your studentsthe best angle and view. This might mean the side, front, middle or back of the room. Use conciselanguage during the demo and point to specific areas of focus. Then ask the students to try itthemselves. Use the same concise language while the students are practicing the pose.In a C1, full demos are required for Chaturanga, Boat Pose and Crow Pose.DEMO WHILE TEACHINGDemo the pose while your students are alsoperforming the pose. Use general form cues toguide your students into a particular posture. As you do so, make your way toward the side of the room in which your students will face. Mirror your students and physically move into the postureyourself. It’s essential to move to the place inthe classroom that offers students the best view and remember you will be doing the pose on the opposite side. Use this option when students willbe in a pose for several breaths and when it’s safe for your students to look without straining theirneck or shoulders.In a C1, optional demos while teaching include Warrior Two, Extended Side Angle, ReverseWarrior, Revolved Crescent Lunge, Warrior One, Half Pigeon and Camel.CHATURANGAAsk your students to come to their knees andwatch the demonstration. Chaturanga is physically demanding pose so encourage your students tomodify as they need throughout their practice. Give them all three options during your demo.Start with High Plank Pose. From a Halfway Lift,plant your hands on the mat and step back to High Plank. Walk them through the ground up cues toproperly get into High Plank Pose.Next, explain moving from High to Low Plank.From High Plank Pose, shift forward and bendyour elbows up to 90 degrees. Walk them through the ground up cues to properly get into Low Plank Pose. Let students know that shifting your body forward is crucial to maintaining the optimalalignment from High Plank to Low Chaturanga and achieving a 90 degree angle at your elbows andwrists. Also emphasize bringing weight into thefront triad of the palm (the first finger and thumb) to relieve pressure in the back of the palm at thewrist.Then move into Upward Facing Dog. FromChaturanga, turn the tops of your feet down and straighten your arms. Walk them through ground up cues here.Finally move to Downward Facing Dog. FromUpward Facing Dog, flip or curl your toes under,push into your hands, engage your abdominals and send your hips up and back.Stand back up and explain that a second optionin Chaturanga is to drop to your knees for High to Low Plank. Switch directions so that students can see you from a new angle. Now move through HighDemos</p>
