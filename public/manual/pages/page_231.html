<p>5.14 © COREPOWER YOGA CONTRACTIONSWhen a muscle contracts, the brain sends a signal to the muscle that tells the fibers to lengthen,shorten or stay strong in a static position.1.Concentric - Muscle engagement during active muscle shortening.2.Eccentric - Muscle engagement during active muscle lengthening.3.Isometric - Muscle engagement under constant muscle length without movement.Example of Concentric to Eccentric AThe brain tells the rectus abdominals that it is time to perform a crunch. The rectus abdominal fibers shorten,causing the spine to flex and the chest to lift off the floor into a crunch. This is a concentric contraction for therectus abdominals. When lowering the chest back down to the starting position, the rectus abdominals contract eccentrically to lower the torso back to the ground with control.Example of Eccentric to Concentric BWhen lowering into a chaturanga, the triceps muscle works eccentrically (while lengthening) to control the elbowflexion (bending) during the lowering phase (high to low) of a chaturanga push-up. It must in order to fight to force of gravity. The triceps works concentrically to produce elbow extension to raise the body back up from low to High Plank position.MUSCLE BALANCEMuscle balance is the relationship between the Agonist and Antagonist. It is important to have muscle balance to prevent injury. If the Agonist is much stronger than the Antagonist, the Agonist can overpower and injure the Antagonist. Muscle imbalance is quite common. Know commonimbalances found in the average student and ways you can encourage through Yoga muscle balance.•Agonist - The primary muscle(s) responsible for the desired motion at a joint•Antagonist - Muscle(s) directly opposite (on the other side of the joint) as the agonist/primemover•Stabilizers - These muscles hold a joint in place while the exercise is being performed and the main muscles are supported. The stabilizersmuscles are not necessarily moving during an exercise, but provide stationary support.•Co-contraction - Agonist and Antagonist are simultaneously active. Muscle co-contraction increases joint stability and facilitates joint control.Every muscle has an opposing muscle group. For Example, Bicep to Tricep, Pectoralis toTrapezius, Quadriceps to Hamstrings, Rectus Abdominals to Erector Spinae
