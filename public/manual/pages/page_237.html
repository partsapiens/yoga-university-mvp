It is important to always give our students a proper warm up so we arealways working with the supplest soft tissue.TENSION and COMPRESSIONTension is when soft tissue is not elastic enough to stretch to the full range of motion. Tensionis tightness in a muscle or connective tissuethat restricts movement. Overtime, with slow and steady stretching, you will see a change in elasticity and an increase in range of motion.Compression is when solid matter makes contact with another piece of solid matter and this contact stops the range of motion. Compression is when a bone hits another bone and cannot pass throughit, thus stopping the body at that position. Wealso experience compression of soft tissue, when muscle or fat gets squeezed between two bones. This can also restrict the movements of the body.When practicing yoga asana, a studentexperiences both tension and compression in their body. By exploring some of these common sites of compression we can learn much about reading and understanding our students’ bodies from head to toe. This knowledge will allow you to cue to what you see in the room and connect with studentsafter class by answering questions about their practice.Elbow CompressionEXTENSION: ulna to humerusPart of the ulna forms a hook shaped bone that fits into the notch of the humerus. The ulna hook pivots around the humerus until it bangs into the base of humerus socket. That is compression Wesee this in hypo/hyperextension of the elbow in any posePRONATION: radius to ulnaWhen rotating the palm from face up to facedown, the radius rotates around the ulna. The ulna doesn’t move, the radius rotates around the ulna to pronate the palm. Compression occurs when the radius hits the ulna, compressing the soft tissue in between. How far you can pronate is dictated by
