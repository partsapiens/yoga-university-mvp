<p>5.10 © COREPOWER YOGA JointsJoints are locations on the body where two ormore bones make contact. Joints are constructed to allow movement and provide support. They are designed to be innately frictionless, absorb and control impact. Healthy joints house frictionless movement and mitigate external impact. In yoga, we focus on three types of joints:Hinge AThese function to allow mobility in forward andbackward movements or flexion and extension and to limit other mobility. ex. elbow, kneeBall and Socket BThe have the greatest mobility, allowing formovement in all 3 planes. Functional movementis for changing direction when walking, running or reaching. ex. hip, shoulderIntervertebral or Compressive JointLocated between the vertebrae of the spine, these allow limited mobility but provide great stability to protect the spinal cord.MOBILITY VS. STABILITYBeing mindful about joint structure will support you in choosing and teaching yoga posesappropriately with the best intentions for yourstudents. The shoulder joint is commonly injured due to its great range of motion and lack ofstability. Proper alignment in shoulder activating yoga poses will greatly reduce the risk of injury.Inherent joint stability depends on the shape of the adjacent bones, density of connective tissue surrounding the joint capsule and strength ofmuscles that cross the joint. Joints with increased mobility due to adjacent bones tend to provideless innate structural stability. These joints require additional support from soft tissue structures(muscles, tendons, ligaments). Structuralimbalance or weakness of the supporting tissuessurrounding mobile joints introduces increased riskof injury (subluxation, impingement or dislocation).Conversely, joints with more innate structural stability due to adjacent bones tend towarddecreased mobility. Because of the enhanced stability, these joints do not rely on additional support from soft tissue structures.Example of Increased Mobility: Shoulder Joint Because of the shallow, cup-like shape of the outward-facing portion of the scapula (glenoidfossa) which does not completely house the head of the humerus (upper arm). The range of motionavailable is flexion, extension, abduction, horizontal ab/adduction, internal and external rotation,circumduction. In yoga, Eagle arms.Example of Increased Stability: Hip JointBecause of the shape and surface-to-surface contact area of the joint itself, created by theconnection between spherical head of the femurbone (the ball) within the acetabulum of the pelvis (the socket), and the vertical orientation of thejoint during weight bearing (standing), the hip joint is innately stable. While the structure of hip jointclassifies it similar to the shoulder joint as a “ball and socket” joint, the depth and orientation (down and out) of the acetabulum (socket) of the pelvis,as compared to the glenoid fossa (socket) of the scapula is what increases the stability of the hip joint versus that of the shoulder joint. Similar tothe shoulder joint, motions available at the hip joint are: flexion-extension, ab/adduction, and internal and external rotation, as well as circumduction. In yoga, supine figure-four.
