  "content": "## 4.1 Principles of Assisting\n\n* **Consent & choice**: verbal opt‑in and clear non‑touch options every class.\n* **See first, then say, then show**: verbal → directional → demo → light touch when needed.\n* **Stability before depth**: foundation → spine → joints → refinements.\n* **Neutral, supportive contact**: broad, steady hands; avoid pushing joints into range.\n* **Student‑directed depth**: offer actions the student can create rather than imposing shape.\n\n## 4.2 Sample Assists by Pose\n\n### Child's Pose — Balasana (sacrum length)\n\n* Teacher hands broad at sacrum; invite length back through hips.\n* Verbal: \"Press your hands down and draw your hips back.\"\n\n### Standing Forward Fold — Uttanasana (hamstring space)\n\n* One hand at sacrum for grounding, the other guides length through spine.\n* Verbal: \"Soften knees; hinge at hips; lengthen crown forward.\"\n\n### Halfway Lift — Ardha Uttanasana (scapular set)\n\n* Light touch to upper back: \"Draw shoulder blades onto your back.\"\n* Maintain neutral neck; avoid pressing on cervical spine.\n\n### Warrior II — Virabhadrasana II (hip stability)\n\n* Square shoulders over hips; cue knee to track 2nd/3rd toe.\n* Verbal: \"Reach evenly through both arms; soften front ribs.\"\n\n### Side Plank — Vasisthasana (stacking)\n\n* Guide rib cage up; stack shoulder over wrist, hips over heels.\n* Offer block under bottom hand or lower knee variation.\n\n## 4.17 Props — Types & Uses\n\n* **Blocks**: floor rises to meet hands; stability in standing/folding and balance shapes.\n* **Straps**: extend reach; shoulder opening; bind rehearsal without spinal collapse.\n* **Wall**: alignment reference; load sharing for balance/inversions.\n* **Bolsters/blankets**: support joints; restorative comfort; subtle angle changes.\n\n> Props make poses *truer*, not easier—prioritize alignment and nervous‑system safety.\n\n## 4.19 Safety & Contraindications\n\n### What is a contraindication?\n\nA factor that advises caution or modification. Examples: acute injury, uncontrolled hypertension, recent surgery, pregnancy considerations, vertigo.\n\n### Teacher checklist\n\n* Offer at least one **non‑weight‑bearing** option for wrists/shoulders in vinyasa.\n* Keep **neck neutral** in folds and backbends; avoid end‑range loading.\n* Teach **exit strategies** for balances and deep hip shapes.\n* Invite **self‑pacing**, hydration, and rest at any time.\n",
