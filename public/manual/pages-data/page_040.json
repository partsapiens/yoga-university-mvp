The pairs of opposites (dualism) does not affect the yogi.WHO IS PATANJALI There is little historical information available on Patanjali. Scholars suggest several personsmay have developed yoga under the pseudonym Patanjali. In any case, Patanjali’s Yoga Sutrasare a precise set of doctrines and principles that create the foundation for living a Yogic life. They are intended to purify and create alignment inthe mind and spirit. They were compiled sometime between 200 BCE and 200 CE. Sutra translatesas unbroken thread of consciousness that draws together the beads of thought and all humanexperiences.The Yoga Sutras is 196 short verses or shlokas, broken down into 4 parts or pada. It is written in order (“nyasa”) to allow for easier memorization and passing down. Each thread is a pearl of wisdom upon which a teacher expands and adds their own meaning and experience.

Knower, act of knowing, or what is known.42.The argumentative condition is the confused mixing of the word, its right meaning, andknowledge.43.When the memory is purified and the mindshines forth as the object alone, it is called non- argumentative.44.In this way the meditative and the ultra-meditative having the subtle for their objects are also described.45.The province of the subtle terminates withpure matter that has no pattern or distinguishing mark.46.These constitute seeded contemplations.47.On attaining the purity of the ultra-meditative state there is the pure flow of spiritual consciousness.48.Therein is the faculty of supreme wisdom.49.The wisdom obtained in the higher states of consciousness is different from that obtained byinference and testimony as it refers to particulars.50.The habitual pattern of thought stands in the way of other impressions.51.With the suppression of even that through the suspension of all OPTIONS of the mind, contemplation without seed is attained.Part Two on Spiritual Disciplines1.Austerity, the study of sacred texts, andthe dedication of action to God constitute the discipline of Mystic Union.2.This discipline is practiced for the purpose of acquiring fixity of mind on the Lord, free from allimpurities and agitations, or on One’s Own Reality, and for attenuating the afflictions.3.The five afflictions are ignorance, egoism,attachment, aversion, and the desire to cling to life.4.Ignorance is the breeding place for all theothers whether they are dormant or attenuated, partially overcome or fully operative.5.Ignorance is taking the non-eternal for the eternal, the impure for the pure, evil for good and non-self as self.6.Egoism is the identification of the power that knows with the instruments of knowing.7.Attachment is that magnetic pattern which clusters in pleasure and pulls one towards such experience.8.Aversion is the magnetic pattern which clusters6. 6© Yoga Flow YOGA\n\n---\n[← Prev](/pages/page-250.md) &nbsp; [Top](/index.md) &nbsp; [Next →](/pages/page-252.md)\n\n# Page 252\n\n© Yoga Flow YOGA 6. 6in misery and pushes one from such experience.9.Flowing by its own energy, established even in the wise and in the foolish, is the unending desire for life.10.These patterns when subtle may be removed by developing their contraries.11.Their active afflictions are to be destroyed by meditation.12.The impressions of works have their roots in afflictions and arise as experience in the present and the future births.13.When the root exists, its fruition is birth, life and experience.14.They have pleasure or pain as their fruit, according as their cause be virtue or vice.15.All is misery to the wise because of the pains of change, anxiety, and purificatory acts.16.The grief which has not yet come may be avoided.17.The cause of the avoidable is thesuperimposition of the external world onto the unseen world.18.The experienced world consists of theelements and the senses in play. It is of the nature of cognition, activity and rest, and is for thepurpose of experience and realization.19.The stages of the attributes effectingthe experienced world are the specialized and the unspecialized, the differentiated and the undifferentiated.20.The indweller is pure consciousness only,which though pure, sees through the mind and is identified by ego as being only the mind.21.The very existence of the seen is for the sake of the seer.22.Although Creation is discerned as not real for the one who has achieved the goal, it is yet real in that Creation remains the common experience to others.23.The association of the seer with Creation is for the distinct recognition of the objectiveworld, as well as for the recognition of the distinct nature of the seer.24.The cause of the association is ignorance.25.Liberation of the seer is the result of thedisassociation of the seer and the seen, with the disappearance of ignorance.26.The continuous practice of discrimination isthe means of attaining liberation.27.Steady wisdom manifests in seven stages.28.On the destruction of impurity by thesustained practice of the limbs of Union, the light of knowledge reveals the faculty of discrimination.29.The eight limbs of Union are self-restraintin actions, fixed observance, posture, regulation of energy, mind-control in sense engagements, concentration, meditation, and realization.30.Self-restraint in actions includes abstention from violence, from falsehoods, from stealing, from sexual engagements, and from acceptance of gifts.31.These five willing abstentions are not limited by rank, place, time or circumstance and constitute the Great Vow.32.The fixed observances are cleanliness,contentment, austerity, study and persevering devotion to God.33.When improper thoughts disturb the mind, there should be constant pondering over theopposites.34.Improper thoughts and emotions such as those of violence- whether done, caused to bedone, or even approved of - indeed, any thought originating in desire, anger or delusion, whether mild medium or intense - do all result in endless pain and misery. Overcome such distractions by pondering on the opposites.35.When one is confirmed in non-violence, hostility ceases in his presence.36.When one is firmly established in speaking truth, the fruits of action become subservient to him.37.All jewels approach him who is confirmed in honesty.38.When one is confirmed in celibacy, spiritual vigor is gained.39.When one is confirmed in non-possessiveness, the knowledge of the why and how of existence is attained.40.From purity follows a withdrawal from enchantment over one’s own body as well asa cessation of desire for physical contact with others.41.As a result of contentment there is purity of mind, one-pointedness, control of the senses, and fitness for the vision of the self.42.Supreme happiness is gained via contentment.6. 7© Yoga Flow YOGA\n\n---\n[← Prev](/pages/page-251.md) &nbsp; [Top](/index.md) &nbsp; [Next →](/pages/page-253.md)\n\n# Page 253\n\n6. 743.Through sanctification and the removal ofimpurities, there arise special powers in the body and senses.44.By study comes communion with the Lord in the Form most admired.45.Realization is experienced by making the Lord the motive of all actions.46.The posture should be steady and comfortable.47.In effortless relaxation, dwell mentally on the Endless with utter attention.48.From that there is no disturbance from the dualities.49.When that exists, control of incoming and outgoing energies is next.50.It may be external, internal, or midway,regulated by time, place, or number, and of brief or long.51.Energy-control which goes beyond the sphere of external and internal is the fourth level - thevital.52.In this way, that which covers the light is destroyed.53.Thus the mind becomes fit for concentration.54.When the mind maintains awareness, yet does not mingle with the senses, nor the senses withsense impressions, then self-awareness blossoms.55.In this way comes mastery over the senses.Part Three on Divine Powers1.One-pointedness is steadfastness of the mind.2.Unbroken continuation of that mental ability is meditation.3.That same meditation when there is onlyconsciousness of the object of meditation and not of the mind is realization.4.The three appearing together are self-control.5.By mastery comes wisdom.6.The application of mastery is by stages.7.The three are more efficacious than the restraints.8.Even that is external to the seedless realization.9.The significant aspect is the union of the mind with the moment of absorption, when the outgoingthought disappears and the absorptive experience appears.10.From sublimation of this union comes the peaceful flow of unbroken unitive cognition.11.The contemplative transformation of this is equal mindedness, witnessing the rise and destruction of distraction as well as one-pointedness itself.12.The mind becomes one-pointed when thesubsiding and rising thought-waves are exactly similar.13.In this state, it passes beyond the changes of inherent characteristics, properties and the conditional OPTIONS of object or sensory recognition.14.The object is that which preserves the latent characteristic, the rising characteristic or the yet- to-be-named characteristic that establishes one entity as specific.15.The succession of these changes in that entity is the cause of its modification.16.By self-control over these three-fold changes (of property, character and condition), knowledge of the past and the future arises.17.The sound of a word, the idea behind the word, and the object the idea signifies are often takenas being one thing and may be mistaken for one another. By self-control over their distinctions, understanding of all languages of all creatures arises.18.By self-control on the perception of mental impressions, knowledge of previous lives arises.19.By self-control on any mark of a body, the wisdom of the mind activating that body arises.20.By self-control on the form of a body, by suspending perceptibility and separatingeffulgence therefrom, there arises invisibility and inaudibility.21.Action is of two kinds, dormant and fruitful. By self-control on such action, one portends the time of death.22.By performing self-control on friendliness, the strength to grant joy arises.23.By self-control over any kind of strength, such as that of the elephant, that very strength arises.24.By self-control on the primal activator comes knowledge of the hidden, the subtle, and thedistant.6.8© Yoga Flow YOGA\n\n---\n[← Prev](/pages/page-252.md) &nbsp; [Top](/index.md) &nbsp; [Next →](/pages/page-254.md)\n\n# Page 254\n\n© Yoga Flow YOGA 6. 825.By self-control on the Sun comes knowledge of spatial specificities.26.By self-control on the Moon comes knowledge of the heavens.27.By self-control on the Polestar arises knowledge of orbits.28.By self-control on the navel arises knowledge of the constitution of the body.29.By self-control on the pit of the throat one subdues hunger and thirst.30.By self-control on the tube within the chest one acquires absolute steadiness.31.By self-control on the light in the head one envisions perfected beings.32.There is knowledge of everything from intuition.33.Self-control on the heart brings knowledge of the mental entity.34.Experience arises due to the inability of discerning the attributes of vitality from theindweller, even though they are indeed distinct from one another. Self-control brings trueknowledge of the indweller by itself.35.This spontaneous enlightenment results inintuitional perception of hearing, touching, seeing and smelling.36.To the outward turned mind, the sensory organs are perfections, but are obstacles to realization.37.When the bonds of the mind caused by action have been loosened, one may enter the body ofanother by knowledge of how the nerve-currents function.38.By self-control of the nerve-currents utilizing the life-breath, one may levitate, walk on water,swamps, thorns, or the like.39.By self-control over the maintenance of breath, one may radiate light.40.By self-control on the relation of the ear to the ether one gains distant hearing.41.By self-control over the relation of the body to the ether, and maintaining at the same time thethought of the lightness of cotton, one is able to pass through space.42.By self-control on the mind when it isseparated from the body - the state known as the Great Transcorporeal - all coverings are removed from the Light.43.Mastery over the elements arises when their gross and subtle forms, as well as their essential characteristics, and the inherent attributes and experiences they produce, is examined in self-control.44.Thereby one may become as tiny as an atom as well as having many other abilities, such asperfection of the body, and non-resistance to duty.45.Perfection of the body consists in beauty, grace, strength and adamantine hardness.46.By self-control on the changes that the sense- organs endure when contacting objects, and on the power of the sense of identity, and of the influence of the attributes, and the experience all theseproduce - one masters the senses.47.From that come swiftness of mind,independence of perception, and mastery over primordial matter.48.To one who recognizes the distinctive relation between vitality and indweller comes omnipotence and omniscience.49.Even for the destruction of the seed ofbondage by desirelessness there comes absolute independence.50.When invited by invisible beings one shouldbe neither flattered nor satisfied, for there is yet a possibility of ignorance rising up.51.By self-control over single moments and their succession there is wisdom born of discrimination.52.From that there is recognition of two similars when that difference cannot be distinguished byclass, characteristic or position.53.Intuition, which is the entire discriminativeknowledge, relates to all objects at all times, and is without succession.54.Liberation is attained when there is equal purity between vitality and the indweller.Part Four on Realizations1.Psychic powers arise by birth, drugs,incantations, purificatory acts or concentrated insight.2.Transformation into another state is by the directed flow of creative nature.3.Creative nature is not moved into action by any6. 9© Yoga Flow YOGA\n\n---\n[← Prev](/pages/page-253.md) &nbsp; [Top](/index.md) &nbsp; [Next →](/pages/page-255.md)\n\n# Page 255\n\n6. 9incidental cause, but by the removal of obstacles, as in the case of a farmer clearing his field ofstones for irrigation.4.Created minds arise from egoism alone.5.There being difference of interest, one mind is the director of many minds.6.Of these, the mind born of concentrated insight is free from the impressions.7.The impressions of unitive cognition are neither good nor bad. In the case of the others, there arethree kinds of impressions.8.From them proceed the development of the tendencies which bring about the fruition ofactions.9.Because of the magnetic qualities of habitual mental patterns and memory, a relationship ofcause and effect clings even though there may be a change of embodiment by class, space and time.10.The desire to live is eternal, and the thought- clusters prompting a sense of identity arebeginningless.11.Being held together by cause and effect,substratum and object - the tendencies themselves disappear on the dissolution of these bases.12.The past and the future exist in the object itself as form and expression, there beingdifference in the conditions of the properties.13.Whether manifested or unmanifested they are of the nature of the attributes.14.Things assume reality because of the unity maintained within that modification.15.Even though the external object is the same, there is a difference of cognition in regard to the object because of the difference in mentality.16.And if an object known only to a single mind were not cognized by that mind, would it then exist?17.An object is known or not known by the mind, depending on whether or not the mind is colored by the object.18.The mutations of awareness are always known on account of the changelessness of its Lord, theindweller.19.Nor is the mind self-luminous, as it can be known.20.It is not possible for the mind to be both the perceived and the perceiver simultaneously.21.In the case of cognition of one mind byanother, we would have to assume cognition of cognition, and there would be confusion of memories.22.Consciousness appears to the mind itself as intellect when in that form in which it does notpass from place to place.23.The mind is said to perceive when it reflectsboth the indweller (the knower) and the objects of perception (the known).24.Though variegated by innumerable tendencies, the mind acts not for itself but for another, for the mind is of compound substance.25.For one who sees the distinction, there is no further confusing of the mind with the self.26.Then the awareness begins to discriminate, and gravitates towards liberation.27.Distractions arise from habitual thought patterns when practice is intermittent.28.The removal of the habitual thought patterns is similar to that of the afflictions alreadydescribed.29.To one who remains undistracted in even the highest intellection there comes the equal-minded realization known as The Cloud of Virtue. This is a result of discriminative discernment.30.From this there follows freedom from cause and effect and afflictions.31.The infinity of knowledge available to such a mind freed of all obscuration and property makes the universe of sensory perception seem small.32.Then the sequence of change in the threeattributes comes to an end, for they have fulfilled their function.33.The sequence of mutation occurs in everysecond, yet is comprehensible only at the end of a series.34.When the attributes cease mutativeassociation with awareness, they resolve intodormancy in Nature, and the indweller shines forth as pure consciousness. This is absolute freedom.\n\n---\n[← Prev](/pages/page-254.md) &nbsp; [Top](/index.md) &nbsp; [Next →](/pages/page-256.md)\n\n# Page 256\n\n---\n[← Prev](/pages/page-255.md) &nbsp; [Top](/index.md) &nbsp; [Next →](/pages/page-257.md)\n\n# Page 257\n\n6 .11 © Yoga Flow YOGA The eight limbed yogic path is a step-by-step path toward the realization of yoga, or union, with the universal self. The eight limbs progress from themost external and gross practices, to the most internal and subtle practices.YAMA Patanjali’s Yoga Sutra lists five yamas, or moral restraints, which apply specifically to how youbehave outwardly toward other beings.- Ahimsa Non-Violence, Freedom from Harming- Satya Truthfulness- Asteya Non-Stealing, Freedom from Stealing- Brahmacharya Moderation- Aparigraha Non-Hoarding, Freedom from GraspingNIYAMA Patanjali’s Yoga Sutra lists five niyamas, orobservances, which apply specifically to how you conduct yourself on a more personal level.- Saucha Cleanliness- Santosha Contentment- Tapas Self Discipline- Svadhyaya Self Study- Isvara-pranidhana SurrenderASANA Originally asana referred to a yogi’s meditation seat; the word literally translated means “seat.”It also referred to one’s perspective based on the seat one was in. The view or point of referencechanges based on where or how one sits. This expanded the view of the yogi’s mind. As the practice of yoga has evolved, asana has cometo refer to the practice of all the physical yoga postures. The third limb is about gaining control over our physical bodies. Although the YogaSutra doesn’t say much about the physical asana practice, it does say “Sthira Sukham Asanam,”which means, “steady comfortable seat.” As asana is practiced and refined, challenging poses become more accessible and the practitioner is able to findThe 8 Limb Yogic Pathmore comfort in each pose. Eventually this skill can be taken “off the mat” as well, so that we are able to tread through life with more steadiness andease.PRANAYAMA The fourth limb, pranayama, refers to one’sown vital energy and life force. It is made up of two Sanskrit words: “prana” which means “lifeforce” or “vital energy” and “yama” which means “expansion” or “extension.” Our breath is ourmost tangible doorway into working with our own energy. For example, if you hold your breath for60 seconds, you may feel agitated or hot. If you were to slow down your exhales so that they were twice as long as your inhales, there would be anoticeable energetic shift. You would feel calmer and a racing mind may begin to slow down. Byworking with our breath, we learn how to manage our energy more skillfully.PRATYAHARA The fifth limb, pratyahara, means “withdrawal from the senses.” It bridges the gap from theexternal to the internal. In practicing pratyahara, one stops reaching out through the senses toward external stimuli. Energy and attention is directedinward toward the heart and mind, and the yogi is able to transition more easily toward the finalthree limbs. If you want to know your highest self, you can’t only look outward. You must look inward as well, or you will be missing the whole picture.“If you don’t go within, you go without.” Neale Donald WalshDHARANA Dharana is the initial step of the seventh limb. We live in a busy world that is constantly pulling ourattention in many different directions. We have been conditioned to constantly be on the lookout for the next “shiny object.” Through the practiceof dharana, we train the mind to focus on a single point, or object, for a prolonged period of time.\n\n---\n[← Prev](/pages/page-256.md) &nbsp; [Top](/index.md) &nbsp; [Next →](/pages/page-258.md)\n\n# Asana\n\n6 .12 The cultivation of a single point of focus requires patience, persistence and compassion towardoneself.DHYANA Once the body and mind have been prepared, weenter the seventh limb, dhyana, or meditation. In a true meditative state, the meditator is not aware of the actual act of meditating. They are onlyaware of the meditation object itself (examples:sound, mantra, image, intention, open awareness).In concentration practice, the practitioner isaware of the choice to focus, again and again, on the object. The ability to meditate first requiresthat one is able to concentrate. Meditation isusually described as a graceful practice, whereas concentration is described as an effortful practice. You can’t sit down and force yourself to meditate, but you can sit down and practice concentration, which will lead to longer and longer moments ofmeditation.SAMADHI Samadhi is the experience of enlightenment and non-duality; the experience of yoga. The wordsamadhi is made up of two Sanskrit words:“sama” which means “even” or “same” and “dhi” which means intellect. Samadhi refers to astate of complete evenness or equilibrium of the mind. It is what Patanjali describes in the Yoga Sutra as the cessation of the fluctuations ofthe mind. In samadhi, you no longer experience yourself as separate from everything else. There is no separation between the individual and the universal, oneness is realized.DharanaDhyana\nAsana\nYamasNiyamasPranayamaPratyaharaSamadhiWHAT IS YOGA?Yoga comes from the root ‘yuj’ meaning yoke, to join or union. Yoga is skill in action. Yoga is the realization ofoneness of being; the experience that we are all one. Yoga is the experience of lacking nothing.“Yoga is the cessation of the fluctuations of the mind.”- Patanjali’s Yoga Sutra“Yoga is clear, discerning, dynamic participation in one’s life.” - Bhagavad Gita\n\n---\n[← Prev](/pages/page-257.md) &nbsp; [Top](/index.md) &nbsp; [Next →](/pages/page-259.md)\n\n# Page 259\n\n6 .13 © Yoga Flow YOGA\n",
