Central teachings include:\n\n* **Chitta Vritti Nirodha** — yoga as the quieting of mental fluctuations.\n* **Abhyasa & Vairagya** — sustained practice and non‑attachment.\n* **Kleshas** — root causes of suffering: ignorance, egoism, attachment, aversion, fear.\n* **Kriya Yoga** — the yoga of action: tapas, svadhyaya, Ishvara pranidhana.\n\n## 5.5 Yogic Lifestyle & Modern Practice\n\nApplying yoga philosophy off the mat creates coherence between practice and daily life:\n\n* Adopt balanced nutrition and mindful consumption.\n* Align work and relationships with the yamas and niyamas.\n* Integrate meditation and pranayama into daily routine.\n* Engage in seva (selfless service) and community care.\n\n> Yoga is a lifelong, evolving practice — both inner discipline and outward compassion.\n",
