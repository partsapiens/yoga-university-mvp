  "content": "## 6.1 History of Yoga — Overview\n\nA concise, teacher‑friendly map of how yoga's ideas and practices evolved from early Vedic rituals to today's global movement. Use historically‑aware language and avoid over‑certain claims; dates are approximate.\n\n## 6.2 Sankalpa — Heartfelt Intention\n\n*Sankalpa* is an affirmative intention rooted in values, not outcomes. Use it to shape class theming and support consistent practice.\n\n* Phrase in present tense: \"I am…\", \"I choose…\", \"I embody…\"\n* Align with yamas/niyamas; revisit at Integration and Savasana.\n* Keep it concise (one breath long) and repeatable.\n\n## 6.3 Yoga Sutras of Patanjali\n\nShort aphorisms (c. 2nd–5th century CE) codifying yoga's path. Key ideas:\n\n* **Yogaś citta‑vṛtti‑nirodhaḥ** — stilling mental fluctuations.\n* **Abhyāsa** (steady practice) + **Vairāgya** (non‑attachment).\n* **Kleśas**: avidyā, asmitā, rāga, dveṣa, abhiniveśa.\n* **Kriyā Yoga**: tapas, svādhyāya, Īśvara‑praṇidhāna.\n\n## 6.4 What is Yoga?\n\nFrom the Sanskrit root *yuj* — to yoke, join, or integrate. In practice: a method of aligning body, breath, mind, and values.\n\n* **Process over posture**: yoga is a state and a path, not only shapes.\n* **Four pillars in class**: intention, breath, attention, compassion.\n\n## 6.5 Major Paths of Yoga\n\n* **Jñāna** — study, inquiry, discernment.\n* **Bhakti** — devotion, love, surrender.\n* **Karma** — selfless action, service.\n* **Rāja** — meditative path, often linked with the eight limbs.\n* **Haṭha** — force/balance; physical + subtle techniques to steady the mind.\n\n## 6.6 Key Texts\n\n* **Upaniṣads** — philosophical dialogs on self and reality.\n* **Bhagavad Gītā** — synthesis of paths; duty and devotion.\n* **Yoga Sūtras** — concise framework for practice.\n* **Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā** — medieval manual of techniques.\n\n## 6.7 Historical Timeline\n\n* **Vedic** (c. 1500–500 BCE): early ritual, hymn, and contemplative seeds.\n* **Classical** (c. 200 BCE–500 CE): Sūtras period; codification.\n* **Medieval** (c. 500–1500): Tantric/Haṭha developments.\n* **Modern** (19th–21st c.): global diffusion; posture‑focused schools.\n\n## 6.8 Lineages & Modern Schools\n\nNotable 20th‑century teachers shaped modern asana: Krishnamacharya and students (Iyengar, Pattabhi Jois, Indra Devi), plus later innovators synthesizing vinyasa, alignment, and therapeutics.\n\n## 6.9 Culture & Respectful Teaching\n\n* Credit sources; avoid stereotyping or exoticizing traditions.\n* Use inclusive, trauma‑aware language; offer opt‑outs.\n* Honor cultural roots while teaching accessibly in your context.\n\n## 6.10 Teacher Ethics (Overview)\n\n* Clear boundaries and consent; power dynamics awareness.\n* Ongoing education; refer out beyond scope.\n* Equity: pricing transparency, accessibility, and community care.\n\n## 6.11 The Eight‑Limb Path (Ashtanga)\n\n1. Yama\n2. Niyama\n3. Asana\n4. Pranayama\n5. Pratyahara\n6. Dharana\n7. Dhyana\n8. Samadhi\n\n> See Chapter 5 for in‑depth treatment; this section emphasizes classroom integration.\n\n## 6.12 Eight Limbs in Teaching Practice\n\nTranslate the eight-limb framework into clear classroom moves.\n\n* **Yama/Niyama**: set theme; model language.\n* **Asana**: scaffold options; emphasize stability before depth.\n* **Pranayama**: simple count or cadence embedded in flow.\n* **Pratyahara → Dhyana**: quiet transitions; longer savasana.\n\n## 6.13 Yamas & Niyamas (Recap)\n\nApply as class themes and real‑life practices. Invite one actionable example per student each week.\n\n> For definitions and icons, see Chapter 5 §§5.2–5.3. Here, focus on translation into cues and choices.\n\n## 6.14 Meditation (Dhyana) — Essentials\n\nOffer accessible meditation in every class: 2–5 minutes is enough to practice attention and ease.\n\n* Anchor: breath, sound, or body sensation.\n* Instructions: short, neutral, invitational.\n* Normalize mind‑wandering; cue gentle return.\n\n## 6.15 Mantra & Japa\n\nUse sound as a focusing tool; keep participation optional and inclusive.\n\n* Choose simple phrases (e. g., Om Shanti) or value‑based English mantras.\n* Japa: quiet repetition, breath‑paced; beads optional.\n* Invite resonance and rest after chanting.\n\n## 6.16 Mudras — Hand Seals\n\nSimple mudras can support breath and focus. Offer as optional refinements.\n\n* **Jnana Mudra**: thumb + index touch; rest fingers long.\n* **Hridaya Mudra**: ring finger + thumb; index at base of thumb.\n* **Anjali Mudra**: palms together at heart; steady breath.\n\n## 6.17 Sanskrit Basics for Teachers\n\n* Pronunciation: short vs. long vowels (a/ā, i/ī, u/ū), retroflex consonants (ṭ, ḍ, ṇ).\n* Common pose endings: *‑āsana* (posture), *uttāna* (intense stretch), *parivṛtta* (revolved).\n* Use both English & Sanskrit names; keep tone inclusive and clear.\n\n## 6.18 Using Sanskrit in Class\n\nKeep Sanskrit supportive, not performative. Prioritize clarity and accessibility.\n\n* Give English + Sanskrit on first mention; then use one consistently.\n* Translate metaphors; avoid literalism that confuses students.\n* Invite corrections from community members; model humility.\n\n## 6.19 Pranayama\n\n* **Ujjāyī**: gentle constriction at glottis; oceanic sound.\n* **Nādī Śodhana**: alternate nostril breathing; balance channels.\n* **Kumbhaka**: breath retention; apply with care.\n\n## 6.20 Breath & Nervous System\n\nFrame breath work as a way to regulate arousal and attention. Offer inclusive options and avoid medical claims.\n\n* Longer, slower exhales can support relaxation for many students.\n* Box or ladder breathing to practice steady pacing.\n* Always allow opt‑out and rest; skip retentions for those who prefer.\n\n## 6.21 Coherent Breathing (Even Ratio)\n\nEven‑length inhales and exhales (e. g., 5:5) can help many students feel steadier. Keep it gentle and optional.\n\n* Start with 4:4 for new students; increase only if comfortable.\n* Use silent counting or soft metronome‑like cues.\n\n## 6.22 Box & Ladder Breathing\n\nStructured counts that build pacing and awareness.\n\n* **Box**: inhale–hold–exhale–hold (e. g., 4‑4‑4‑4). Skip holds as needed.\n* **Ladder**: step counts up (4→6→8) then down.\n\n## 6.23 Breath–Movement Linking\n\nCoordinate breath and movement to cultivate focus and rhythm in practice.\n\n* One movement per breath; pause at transitions.\n* Inhale for lifting, opening, backbending; exhale for folding, twisting, forward folds.\n* Cue breath first, then movement; respect individual pace.\n\n## 6.24 Breathwork Cautions & Adaptations\n\nCreate safe, inclusive breath practices that honor individual needs and limitations.\n\n* Never force breath retention; offer natural pauses instead.\n* Avoid intense pranayama for pregnancy, anxiety, or respiratory conditions.\n* Cue \"breathe normally\" as default; advanced techniques are optional add-ons.\n* Model calm, steady breathing yourself throughout class.\n\n## 6.25 Kumbhaka (Breath Retention) — Optional\n\nAdvanced breath retention practices. Offer only to experienced students with clear cautions.\n\n* **Antara Kumbhaka**: retention after inhale (use sparingly).\n* **Bahya Kumbhaka**: retention after exhale (gentler option).\n* Start with natural pauses; never strain or force.\n\n> Skip this section for beginners, pregnancy, anxiety, or any breathing difficulties.\n\n## 6.26 Sound & Breath (Nāda Yoga)\n\nExplore the vibrational aspects of breath and voice as meditation tools.\n\n* **Humming**: simple, accessible sound vibration.\n* **Ujjāyī**: ocean-like sound created at the throat.\n* **Chanting**: longer sound practices with traditional or modern phrases.\n\n## 6.27 Bandhas\n\nSubtle energetic \"locks\" that support core stability and breath awareness. Teach with care and clear instruction.\n\n* **Mula Bandha**: gentle engagement of pelvic floor.\n* **Uddiyana Bandha**: drawing navel in and up (on empty stomach).\n* **Jalandhara Bandha**: gentle chin-to-chest positioning.\n\n## 6.28 Chakras — Subtle Body Map\n\nTraditional energy centers as a framework for self-awareness and class theming. Present as metaphor and tool, not medical fact.\n\n* Seven main chakras aligned along the spine from base to crown.\n* Each associated with elements, colors, qualities, and life themes.\n* Use for class intentions, pose selection, and personal reflection.\n\n## 6.29 Nadis (Ida • Pingala • Sushumna)\n\nEnergy channels in yogic anatomy. Three main nadis provide framework for breath practice and balance.\n\n* **Ida**: left nostril, lunar, cooling, receptive energy.\n* **Pingala**: right nostril, solar, warming, active energy.\n* **Sushumna**: central channel, balance, integration.\n\n## 6.30 Chakras — Overview\n\nQuick reference for the seven traditional chakras.
