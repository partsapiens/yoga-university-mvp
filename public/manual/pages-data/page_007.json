  "content": "## 7.1 Chapter Overview & Objectives\n\nThis chapter translates self‑paced lectures into classroom‑ready moves. You'll apply inclusive, trauma‑aware, and culturally respectful teaching across populations and themes.\n\n### By the end you can…\n\n* State core trauma‑informed principles and embed them in cueing.\n* Differentiate cultural appreciation from appropriation; teach with context.\n* Adapt sequences for pregnancy, postpartum, older adults, and limited mobility.\n* Use mythology, Ayurveda, and koshas as optional, respectful frameworks.\n\n## 7.2 History Review — Advanced Timeline\n\nA compact recap of key eras to support accurate theming. Dates are approximate and presented as one scholarly view among many.\n\n* **Vedic (c. 1500–500 BCE)**: ritual, hymn, contemplative seeds.\n* **Classical (c. 200 BCE–500 CE)**: codification; Yoga Sūtras.\n* **Medieval (c. 500–1500)**: tantra/haṭha methods, subtle body maps.\n* **Modern (19th–21st c.)**: global diffusion; posture‑forward schools.\n\n## 7.3 Lecture Checkpoint\n\nUse this space to summarize your key takeaways from the related video lecture and list one classroom experiment you'll try this week.\n\n* 1–2 bullet insights.\n* One cue you'll test, one measure of impact.\n\n## 7.4 Trauma‑Informed Yoga\n\n### Principles\n\n* **Safety**: predictable pacing; clear, invitational language.\n* **Choice**: options > corrections; students decide intensity and shape.\n* **Agency**: emphasize interoception; normalize rest and opting out.\n* **Collaboration**: co‑create space norms; welcome feedback.\n\n### Cueing Examples\n\n* Instead of \"*Don't* drop your knees,\" try \"You might place knees down if that feels steadier.\"\n* Offer *where* to feel (\"front of hips\") rather than moral judgments (\"good/bad\").\n\n## 7.5 Lecture Checkpoint\n\nShort reflection space for the corresponding video.\n\n## 7.6 Lecture Checkpoint\n\nShort reflection space for the corresponding video.\n\n## 7.7 Lecture Checkpoint\n\nShort reflection space for the corresponding video.\n\n## 7.8 Lecture Checkpoint\n\nShort reflection space for the corresponding video.\n\n## 7.9 Lecture Checkpoint\n\nShort reflection space for the corresponding video.\n\n## 7.10 Lecture Checkpoint\n\nShort reflection space for the corresponding video.\n\n## 7.11 Cultural Appreciation & Context\n\n### Teach with Context\n\n* Credit sources and teachers; avoid essentializing living traditions.\n* Explain when you adapt practices for your community — and why.\n* Invite multiple interpretations; avoid one‑true‑way claims.\n\n## 7.12 Impact of Social Hierarchy\n\n* Consider affordability, scheduling, and space access in your community.\n* Offer sliding scale or scholarships where feasible; partner with local orgs.\n* Design trauma‑aware consent norms around touch and adjustments.\n\n## 7.13 Implicit Bias\n\n* Notice first impressions; slow down decisions that impact students.\n* Audit your cue library for body/ability assumptions; diversify examples.\n* Rotate demo bodies; avoid always choosing the same student profile.\n\n## 7.14 Inclusive Communication\n\n* Use invitational language (\"might, could, when you're ready\").\n* Name multiple options before asking for effort.\n* Describe sensations and directions; avoid shame‑based cues.\n\n## 7.15 Pregnancy & Special Populations — Overview\n\n**Important:** This material is educational, not medical advice. Always invite students to consult their healthcare providers and to self‑pace.\n\n* Avoid overheating, breath‑holds, and supine compressive shapes as pregnancy progresses.\n* Favor wide stances, props, and side‑lying options.\n* Prioritize pelvic floor and breath coordination over intensity.\n\n## 7.16 First & Second Trimester\n\n* **1st Trimester:** fatigue/nausea common; keep effort moderate; avoid hot rooms.\n* **2nd Trimester:** emphasize balance aids; widen stances; avoid deep closed twists.\n* **Breath:** no retentions; longer, easy exhales; gentle diaphragmatic work.\n\n## 7.17 Third & Fourth Trimester\n\n* **3rd Trimester:** side‑lying savasana; elevated or side planks; focus on stability.\n* **4th Trimester (postpartum):** gradual return; prioritize sleep, bonding, breath, pelvic floor reconnection.\n* Screen for warning signs (pain, bleeding, dizziness) → stop and refer.\n\n## 7.18 Older Adults & Limited Mobility\n\n* Use chairs, walls, and props; teach transitions slowly with clear steps.\n* Favor joint mobility, balance training, and breath over range \"maxing.\"\n* Offer wrist/shoulder alternatives for weight‑bearing shapes.\n\n## 7.19 Mythology of the Poses\n\nMyths offer metaphor, not dogma. Share selectively to illuminate values like courage, compassion, and discernment.\n\n## 7.20 Asana Myths — Examples\n\n* **Tāḍāsana (Mountain)**: steadiness and presence → slow build to balance work.\n* **Vīrabhadrāsana (Warrior)**: courage with humility → power poses + soft gaze.\n* **Naṭarājāsana (Dancer)**: dynamic balance → playful oscillation, micro‑movements.\n\n## 7.21 Ayurveda — A Practical Primer\n\nUse Ayurveda as an optional lens for rhythm and recovery, not as medical claims.\n\n* Balance *doṣa* tendencies with opposite qualities: heavy ↔ light, fast ↔ slow, dry ↔ moist.\n* Seasonal theming: cooling in summer, warming in winter, grounding in autumn.\n* Daily rhythm: consistent sleep, meal timing, and gentle morning breathwork.\n\n## 7.22 Koshas — The Vital Sheaths\n\nFive interwoven \"layers\" of being. Offer as an optional map for sequencing from gross to subtle.\n\n1. **Annamaya** (physical): movement, stability.\n2. **Prāṇamaya** (energy/breath): pacing, pranayama.\n3. **Manomaya** (mind): focus, intention, self‑talk.\n4. **Vijñānamaya** (insight): discernment, choices.\n5. **Ānandamaya** (bliss): rest, connection, ease.\n",
