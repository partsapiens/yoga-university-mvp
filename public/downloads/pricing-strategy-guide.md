## Understanding Your Value Proposition

Before setting any prices, you must clearly understand and articulate the value you provide. Price is simply the external expression of internal value.

### The True Cost of Yoga Instruction

Many yoga teachers undervalue their services by focusing only on the physical aspects. Consider the full scope of what you provide:

**Immediate Value:**
- Professional instruction ensuring safety and proper alignment
- Guided meditation and breathwork techniques
- Stress relief and mental health support
- Physical fitness and flexibility improvement
- Community connection and belonging

**Long-term Value:**
- Injury prevention through proper movement patterns
- Stress management tools for daily life
- Improved sleep quality and emotional regulation
- Enhanced self-awareness and mindfulness
- Sustainable wellness practices

**Transformation Value:**
- Increased confidence and body awareness
- Better coping mechanisms for life challenges
- Deeper spiritual connection and purpose
- Improved relationships through increased presence
- Overall life satisfaction and well-being

### Key Factors That Influence Your Pricing Power

#### Professional Qualifications & Experience
- **200-Hour RYT:** Foundation level, typically supports $18-25/class
- **500-Hour RYT:** Advanced training, supports $25-35/class  
- **Specialty Certifications:** Add $5-10 premium (prenatal, trauma-informed, etc.)
- **Years Teaching:** Each year of experience can add $1-3 to class rates
- **Continuing Education:** Recent workshops and trainings demonstrate commitment

**Pricing Example:**
*Base rate: $20 + 500-hour certification (+$8) + 5 years experience (+$10) + prenatal specialty (+$5) = $43/class premium positioning*

#### Market Position & Location
- **Urban Premium Markets:** NYC, SF, LA can support $35-45/class
- **Urban Secondary Markets:** Austin, Portland, Denver typically $25-35/class
- **Suburban Markets:** Usually $20-30/class depending on affluence
- **Rural Markets:** Often $15-25/class with different value expectations

#### Unique Specializations & Expertise
- **Trauma-Informed Yoga:** Growing demand, can command 15-25% premium
- **Prenatal/Postnatal:** Specialized knowledge supports higher rates
- **Therapeutic/Medical Yoga:** Partnership with healthcare providers
- **Corporate Wellness:** B2B rates typically 50-100% higher than consumer
- **Teacher Training Leadership:** Demonstrates expertise and leadership

#### Studio Overhead & Operational Costs
Understanding your true costs ensures pricing covers both direct and indirect expenses:

**Fixed Costs (Monthly):**
- Studio rent and utilities: $1,200-3,500
- Insurance (liability, property): $150-300
- Software subscriptions (booking, payment): $100-250
- Marketing and advertising: $300-800

**Break-Even Calculation Example:**
*Fixed costs ($2,000) ÷ 80 classes = $25/class + Variable costs ($40) = $65 total cost per class
Target attendance: 10 students = $6.50 minimum charge per student (before profit)*
